00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.840
- It's the Dragon Ancestor!
- The Dragon Ancestor!

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.160
The Dragon Ancestor has appeared!

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.120
Yes.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.070
The Dragon Ancestor.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.150
The Dragon Ancestor is here.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.640
He's come to save us!

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.390
He's come to mend the Artifact!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.480
That's sunlight.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.920
- Real sunlight!
- Wonderful!

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.310
Sunlight at last!

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.150
Sunlight!

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.120
Sunlight is bathing both realms.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.680
We'll never have to fight over it again.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.070
Hurray!

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.150
Long live the Dragon Ancestor!

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.560
Thank you, Dragon Ancestor!

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.070
Hurray!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.840
Does it hurt?

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.030
From this day on,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.470
immortals and demons

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.800
shall know no more war.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.990
You and I

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.000
will wander the Three Realms,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.880
never leaving each other's side.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.030
What do you think?

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.590
But the fish bone inside me

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.840
will keep draining your Demonic Ether.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.340
As long as I can stay with you,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.470
nothing else matters.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.710
From now on,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.200
we'll be the most ordinary couple

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.560
in Hunling City.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.310
I can gladly lose

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.750
the Demonic Ether.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840
This pouch.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.550
(May)

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.280
(the two realms)

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.590
(know eternal peace.)

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.710
You didn't toss it up?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400
How could I

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.680
hand your wish to Feng Tian?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.000
I'll make it come true

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.150
for you.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.470
Ji Li,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.280
we're on the same side now.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.030
Will you

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.310
marry me?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.290
Now, order is restored,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.150
and everything is back to normal.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.400
Hong Zhua,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.800
where is Jin Li's body?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.750
It must not fall

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.310
into demon hands.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.030
Your Grace,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.430
the Three Realms are at peace,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.680
so Jin Li's body need not appear.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.560
The great war

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.950
brought years of disaster
to Hunling City;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.750
our merit was long spent.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.720
Jie Chuan ended the strife

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.120
and repaired the Artifact.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.310
Even without Demonic Ether,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.720
even blind,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.000
he still holds the hearts of all.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.270
Nonsense!

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.720
You once promoted me,

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.920
but our ways now diverge.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.040
I now have my own path.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.750
Jin Li's body

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.490
shall guard the Three Realms forever.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.870
I request to be struck

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.600
from the immortal rolls.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.510
I kept watch through myriad nights.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.070
Does that count for less
than Jie Chuan's single rescue?

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.300
(Hong Residence)

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.830
I'm no longer the Demon Sovereign.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.040
Do you think

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.970
anyone will come to our wedding feast?

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.310
With your terrible popularity?

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.720
Of course not.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.360
I'm different.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.650
Everyone immortal

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.900
(Invitation)
will surely come

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.190
and eat everything you prepare.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.310
Ji Li! Ji Li!

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.360
Ying Ge!

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.240
Ying Ge's here!

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.480
Ying Ge, are you here for our wedding?

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.800
Feng Tian is about

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.270
to destroy the world and rebuild it.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.600
Isn't he already ruler of both realms?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.870
Why bother?

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.830
Ruler?

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.160
But no one acknowledges him.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.750
After Jie Chuan repaired the Artifact,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.630
he became the one
the Three Realms accept.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.720
Deprived of popular support,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.870
Feng Tian fled to Wasteland

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.920
and found Devourer's spell

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.390
that feeds on emotions and desires.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.310
He plans to turn all who defy him

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.270
into puppets.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.830
His power has soared.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.390
He's now indestructible.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.510
He swears

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.480
to wipe out Jie Chuan.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.920
The Three Realms
will face chaos once more.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040
Your Grace,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.040
you still act against everyone
in the end.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.360
For whose sake did we devise

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.920
the demon-slaying plan?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.190
You became a spy,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.160
fell in love with Jie Chuan,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.720
yet in the end obeyed
Feng Tian's command,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.120
betrayed Jie Chuan,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.000
and died by his hand.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.750
But none of us foresaw

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.720
that Jie Chuan would trade
all his memories

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.800
for a single fish bone,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.480
sealing it inside Ji Li.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.400
Ji Li,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.630
innocent and lively,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.720
never knew

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.160
she was already a piece on the board.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.720
400 years have passed;

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.240
they now love each other dearly,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.000
yet Feng Tian has become

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.390
the one who'd destroy the world.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.800
If you were in their place,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.270
what choice would you make?

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.720
I still remember our first meeting.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.480
You were punished for stealing my wine

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.360
and then turned my life

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.870
upside down for 100 years.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.000
The most domineering immortal
in my life.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.040
But if I make

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.430
this choice for you today,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.310
I'm afraid I won't find peace

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.070
even after death.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.510
Jin Li,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.790
I once promised we'd share good wine.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.390
I broke that promise.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.390
Don't hold it against me.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.300
The world was thrown into chaos
by this fish bone scheme.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.790
It's time

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.030
for the two of us to end it.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.910
Master.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.270
Please set the array for me.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.460
If the Fish-Bone Array
can kill Jie Chuan,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.970
it can kill Feng Tian as well.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.590
Ji Li,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.240
the Fish-Bone Array
is a self-destructive.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.510
Once Feng Tian dies,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.960
you will dissolve and perish, too.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.000
Have you thought this through?

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.030
Jie Chuan has done enough for me.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.000
Feng Tian wants to unmake the world.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.550
Right now, the only one who can stand

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.750
before Jie Chuan is me.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.360
I've decided.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.630
Please set the array.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.280
Master.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.240
You're my disciple.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.600
How could I let you face it alone?

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.270
I have poured

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.150
all the power of Jin Li and me

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.360
into the fish bone.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.550
The ice spike can slay Feng Tian

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.440
and still leave you alive.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.910
Master!

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.960
May you and Jie Chuan

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.840
grow old together in peace

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.750
after this battle.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.350
No!

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.390
Master!

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.240
Master!

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.200
Master...

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.030
Master...

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.750
Master...

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.080
Feng Tian!

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.960
It's me.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.960
Jie Chuan,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.120
you're worthless now.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.960
Why do they still worship you as ruler?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.750
I won't accept it!

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.910
So,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.870
you'd destroy the world?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.960
Hypocrite!

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.750
If you don't shelter your people,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.480
they will turn against you.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.840
Even without me,

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.000
they'd find another worthy man

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.150
to follow.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.990
Nonsense!

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.550
Once I kill you,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.910
I become the only ruler!

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.030
What a surprise.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.550
The mighty Demon Sovereign

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.870
has been so weak.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.350
Jie Chuan,

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.200
you're useless now.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.320
Feng Tian,

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.870
you stand alone.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.080
Master and Jin Li gave their souls

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.480
to set things right.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.710
Now,

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.200
after such a long-term scheme,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.550
the blade meant to slay demons

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.150
falls on you.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.630
Ji Li.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.750
Jie Chuan,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.150
we met and fell in love.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.000
Even if I die today,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.510
I won't regret it.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.120
Just don't leave me behind.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.960
Whatever you do, I agree.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.870
You revived Jin Li.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.550
Why aren't you dead?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.270
I was once a weak immortal

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.390
and thought the war was far away.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.630
Then I fell in love with Jie Chuan

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.470
and learned

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.150
the distant war was right before me.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.840
Now,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.720
I step forward for all living things,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.440
ready to give my life

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.630
for righteousness,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.840
to guard the future I believe in,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.120
to guard Jie Chuan,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.480
to guard every soul I cherish.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.910
Why would I lose?

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.600
Why?
