=To Kill A Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.322
=Episode 2=

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:14.675
(Divine Lady Rescues
Drowning New County Magistrate)

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:19.720
(You're in a rush to leave the sect even
though your cultivation is incomplete.)

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.040
(To seek revenge, you cultivated the art
of illusion, causing a reverse flow.)

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.749
(13 Years Ago)
(You must undergo acupuncture)

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.919
(13 Years Ago)
(every day just to stay alive.)

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:32.412
(Elder Baiyun)

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.120
(Is it truly worth it?)

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.639
(I once believed that
Heaven's justice is clear as day.)

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.959
(However, my entire clan was massacred)

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:49.879
(just because my brother was framed.)

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.160
Murderer! Surrender right now!

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.360
(My brother became a scapegoat.)

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:02.239
(He was forced to confess through
torture, and he died a wrongful death.)

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.279
(My parents witnessed
the incident personally.)

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.919
(They took their own lives out of rage.)

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.639
(The villains tried to bury the truth
by burning down the place.)

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.080
(It all started with a thrush.)

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.520
(My family was shattered overnight.)

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.880
(And, I became a wandering orphan.)

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.679
It's you again!

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.199
How dare you steal my buns?
I'll beat you to death!

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.839
(Since then,)

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.759
(I could only survive by stealing food.)

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.199
(I was thrashed around like a rodent.)

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.240
(And, I almost died.)

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.839
(But I insisted on surviving.)

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.320
(I swore that I would
find the mastermind)

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320
(even if I only had one breath left.)

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.639
(No matter where or who he is,)

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.759
(I shall make him
fall to the depths of hell,)

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.600
(and make him pay for what he has done)

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.160
(on my brother's death anniversary.)

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.360
Since this is the will of fate,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.800
you may leave.

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:56.679
Your path

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.440
has only begun.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.839
But I have a piece of advice for you.

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.839
"With a sparrow's frail form,
I met my end upon a rock"?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.240
(With a sparrow's frail form, I met my end upon a rock)
Master, are you trying to say

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.559
that if I insist on seeking the truth,

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.559
I will die at the hands

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.759
of a person
whose name is related to rock?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.399
Shi?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.119
Which Shi?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360
Naturally, it's Shi,
as in beautiful jade and rugged rock.

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.399
(Like a stone met in water.)

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.479
(He occupies a lofty position,)

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.559
(yet will surely
drag you down into the mire.)

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.800
(Are you not afraid?)

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.080
Divine Lady?

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.479
"Divine Lady"?

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.800
This morning, Divine Lady saved me.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.639
What's wrong with me calling her that?

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.479
Magistrate Lu, you must be kidding me.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.279
(Magistrate Lu?)

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.320
She's a demoness.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.839
How could she save you?

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:53.720
It's like this.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.000
I fell into the river.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.137
(Eight Hours Ago,
At the Beginning of the Hour of Si)

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.720
(Eight Hours Ago, At the Beginning of the Hour of Si)
Shen Guan'er was born into a poor family.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.759
(Since I assumed
my position not long ago,)

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.490
(I thought I should be more considerate
of the people's circumstances.)

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.660
(Therefore, I took a stroll.)

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.520
To raise his children.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.679
Mister, what story is
the storyteller talking about?

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.119
It's the Thrush Case.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.119
Have you guys heard about it before?

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.800
Liang Andao,
also known as Justice Liang,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.710
will come to Huachang County together
with Inspecting Envoy Zhai Lu

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.359
in half a month.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.239
As the deal fell through,

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.279
he murdered him out of rage.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.559
He even chopped off Shen Guan'er's head

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.880
and tossed it into the river.

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:29.239
As the saying goes,

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:30.720
what goes around comes around,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.640
and everything has its consequences.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.079
The magistrate could
distinguish right from wrong.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:39.839
In the end, Li Ji ended his own life
in prison out of guilt.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.640
(Since I knew how to swim,)

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.000
(I thought of taking a swim
with the great weather and all.)

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.239
(But the weather was too comfortable.)

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.780
(I actually fell asleep by accident.)

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:50.239
(When I woke up,)

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.959
(water had already entered the boat.)

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.279
(Thus, the boat sank.)

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.720
Help! Someone's in the water!

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.320
(I fell into the river just like that.)

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.100
(When I woke up for the second time,)

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.880
(someone had already rescued me
and brought me ashore.)

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:05.720
(When I opened my eyes,)

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.959
(the first sight I witnessed)

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:09.359
(was Divine Lady holding my hands.)

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.880
Miss only held your collar.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.600
Who said she held your hands?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.359
This morning,
we went into town for groceries.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.600
On our way back, my young attendant
wanted to go boating on the lake.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.320
That's why we went to the lake.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.640
And that's how

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.200
I met Magistrate Lu.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.920
I'm sure it's because of
my dashing appearance

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.799
and innate talent.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.559
Therefore,
you took an instant liking to me.

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.040
That's why you rescued me, am I right?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.119
Magistrate Lu, don't tell me
you became her alibi

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.160
all because you fell for
the demoness's trick.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.959
Fell for her trick?

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.359
What do you mean?

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.880
This noon, someone in the western
marketplace saw Fan Jili, the victim.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.710
That indicates that he was murdered

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.279
after the hour of Wu
and before the hour of Wei.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.839
Could it be
that you never closed your eyes

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.150
and she never
left your side all that while?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.040
You're right.

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.959
I was giddy after I was rescued.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.900
It's not impossible for you
to rush back here

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.480
after murdering the victim.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.680
To think that I treated you
with all my heart.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.119
But you were deceiving me all along!

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.760
This is truly heartbreaking.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:06.359
Magistrate Jiang, take her back.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.380
Interrogate her immediately.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.720
Magistrate Jiang, you said

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.090
the victim's body was found
at the western town outskirts.

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:13.160
How long did it take you all

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.710
to come here from
the western town outskirts?

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.839
Three hours.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.679
Official Lu woke up
at around the hour of Wei.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.500
If I did murder him at the hour of Wu
at the western town outskirts,

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:24.679
how could I rush back
and keep Magistrate Lu company within an hour?

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:26.480
Magistrate Jiang,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.279
Divine Lady is right.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.200
She can't just appear out of nowhere.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.760
She can't just rescue me
and murder the victim at the same time.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.440
I know.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.220
Magistrate Jiang,
you're prejudiced against me.

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:35.720
But Mr. Fan's death

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.399
has nothing to do with me.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.920
All in all,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.519
Divine Lady isn't a suspect.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.440
Magistrate Jiang, this is a huge case.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.000
You should follow me back
and investigate the case.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.320
Do not bother Divine Lady anymore.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.119
Come on.

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:48.320
Let's go.

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.440
Let's go.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:50.920
Divine Lady,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.480
we have plenty of time ahead of us.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.959
Miss, you made a watertight argument.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.480
I'm sure they won't suspect us.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.920
It's not like the plan was flawless.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.920
It actually has a fatal flaw.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.559
I'm taking a gamble too.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.880
On what?

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:12.200
On whether the coroner
of Huachang County

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.600
would do an autopsy

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:16.959
in seven days.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.279
Autopsy?

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:23.200
The body is all burned up.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.150
Do we still need to perform an autopsy?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.200
Of course.

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:26.480
(Cui San, Coroner)
But we need to wait.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.119
We need to wait?

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:29.720
Wait for what?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.860
There are no coroners
in the nearby counties.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.310
Any corpse exhibiting
unusual characteristics

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.760
within the radius of several miles

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.119
will be sent to my place.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.720
In addition, bandits have been
running rampant on Mount Cangyun.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.880
Many people have died.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160
We have to follow

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.519
the order of things, you know?

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.160
Can't you see

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.920
that the morgue is already full?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.200
Even the kitchen in the side courtyard

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.839
was used to store corpses.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.120
Mr. Cui, please don't
blame me for bothering you.

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.160
But I think Magistrate Jiang
doesn't like me.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.959
Not only was he unwilling
to ride in the same carriage as me,

00:07:58.239 --> 00:07:59.720
but he also sent me to you.

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:01.679
But I'll say this first.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.399
I didn't come here of my own accord.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.519
I can forgive the fact that
he doesn't know any courtesy.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.170
But as a coroner, you have quite
the eccentric temper as well.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.320
No one in the magistrate's office

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.160
takes me seriously.

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:16.920
Hey, the body is all burned up.

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:18.390
What can you find out from that?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.519
There are things he can find out.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.480
For example,
the mouth, nose, heart, and lungs.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.040
An experienced coroner

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.960
can tell whether a victim
is recently murdered

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.880
or has been buried for several days

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.200
at first glance.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.280
Unless...

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.479
Unless what?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.840
Unless we reduce the body to ashes.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:43.960
Wait.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:44.990
What are you burning?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.239
I'm asking you.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.640
What were you burning just now?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.000
A bag of charcoal on top of the furnace.

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.080
What charcoal?

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.400
That was half of Fan Jili's skeleton!

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.760
Go away!

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.880
It has already been reduced to ashes.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.119
What can you tell from this?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.799
You...

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.799
Aren't you afraid that Fan Jili
might turn into a vengeful spirit

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.679
and seek revenge on you at night?

00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:17.640
I'll say this first.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.080
I didn't come here of my own accord.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.310
Inspect these remains for me.

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:41.210
Are there any surviving family members
of Li Ji and Shen Xiu?

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.039
Shen Xiu had a wife
and a pair of children.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.840
They passed away a few years ago
after contracting the plague.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.390
Li Ji's entire family perished
in the Yuehua Street fire.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.080
He shouldn't have
any family members left.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.990
He shouldn't have
any family members left, huh?

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:57.280
We have to find out who she is.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.719
Otherwise, it might become too chaotic,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.479
and that'll foil our plan.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.719
Sir, you're literally a demon of chaos.

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:05.239
Why would you be afraid of chaos?

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.770
Of course I'm afraid of chaos.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.320
I'm very timid.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.080
However, there's no need to rush things.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.599
We're not the only ones

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:17.960
who want to stop her advancement.

00:10:21.987 --> 00:10:24.762
(Xuezhao Residence)

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.640
Water!

00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:31.840
Give me water!

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.440
Water...

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.239
You wretch!

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.400
Who exactly are you...

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.479
You don't remember me, huh?

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:03.559
That's fine.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.000
I'll make you

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.559
remember every single bit.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.159
You'll receive your just deserts!

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.640
You'll receive your just deserts!

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.400
Just deserts?

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.200
Everyone dies eventually.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.719
Why the rush?

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.960
I was just doing it for the money.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.440
I...

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.000
I have no idea who he is.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.400
He gave me a letter.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.359
He wanted me to frame Li Ji.

00:11:55.719 --> 00:11:57.679
Who exactly are you?

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.640
Try to recall the details

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.320
of the Thrush Case.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.520
For every single detail you recall,

00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:07.880
I'll give you a bowl of water.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.000
I know.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.239
I know.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.599
Her head.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.080
Shen Xiu's head...

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:28.159
Magistrate Jiang Chun
was the one who found it.

00:12:28.359 --> 00:12:29.520
Jiang Chun?

00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:33.679
(Young Jiang Chun)
Who said you could come here?

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:36.080
I found

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.440
her head.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.400
You may rise.

00:12:46.159 --> 00:12:47.590
I found the head of the dead person.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960
Does that mean my father

00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:51.200
can remain in the magistrate's office?

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.679
Although her head was completely rotten,

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:57.760
it bore the imprint

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.359
left by Li Ji's private seal.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.159
Thus, the evidence chain was complete.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.320
That was how he was sentenced to death.

00:13:04.359 --> 00:13:07.000
Imprinting one's private seal onto
a rotten human head?

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.599
This method of slander

00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:11.840
is utterly despicable!

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.500
Since you don't like to be a human,

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.239
and you like to be an animal,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.080
you can enjoy being an animal.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.039
(The 6th day of the 5th month,
9th year of Zhenghe)

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.039
(I wonder if the rain has stopped?)

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.000
(The weather conditions are unknown.)

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.275
(12 days until
the 7th day of the 6th month)

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.520
