00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.680
I heard your dad

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.600
has been keeping Xingjie
by his side lately,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.560
showing him the ropes personally.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.140
I thought you'd be

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.820
on cloud nine right now.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.520
It was supposed to be a done deal,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.640
but Yao Shu just had to

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.320
stir the pot.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.180
I heard they're inviting a lot of people

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.280
to the banquet.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.700
Your dad usually keeps a low profile.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.479
Why all the fanfare?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.960
Is he planning to announce Xingjie

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.539
as the successor?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.460
Pretty much.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.820
This whole ordeal
is finally coming to an end.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.900
Last year, I was completely overwhelmed.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.260
My dad called for a surprise audit,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.760
digging up every old record
in the books.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.640
From top to bottom,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.000
everyone was living in fear.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.520
I mentioned Mo Dong

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.480
to you, right?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.660
He's been over at Shuangyuan for years,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.060
but still got dragged into this.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.780
In the end, he was sent
straight behind bars.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.600
With all this going on,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.680
I couldn't stick my neck out for him.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.960
That's a good thing.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.660
Your dad's anti-corruption crackdown

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.440
will give Xingjie a clean slate

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.060
when he takes over.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.620
Even our own people are behind bars now.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.160
Let's drop it.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.800
What's your real plan

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.160
for Shuangyuan?

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.340
The funds for the Phase II expansion
still haven't come through.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.300
You're in my dad's bad books

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.420
because of this.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.480
I'm the only one
holding the line for you.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.480
Cash flow has been

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.800
incredibly tight.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.120
I just need
a little more breathing room.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.620
Didn't that new Deputy GM

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.260
you guys sent over already fix

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.880
the funding issue?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.440
That guy must have some real talent,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.440
securing capital

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.580
in a PV market as tough as this.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.560
What's so funny?

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.200
Seems

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.160
you have no idea
who the new Deputy GM is.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.340
Who is it?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.160
My nephew.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.300
Lin Yusen?

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.020
He went to Shuangyuan?

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.120
He's been there since October.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.300
You really haven't been paying attention
to Shuangyuan, have you?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.120
I don't keep track

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.760
of personnel changes at that level.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.340
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.140
What's

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.880
with the sudden overreaction?

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.260
He requested the transfer
to Suzhou himself.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.500
Isn't it a good thing

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.640
he's finally out of the HQ?

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.920
He requested it himself?

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.280
What exactly is the deal

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.480
between you and my nephew?

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.980
I asked you last time,
but you wouldn't say.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.560
Don't keep me in the dark.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.360
What kind of "deal"
could I possibly have

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.579
with a greenhorn like him?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.380
Our deals

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.920
keep falling through because of him.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.360
He has finally caught my attention,
that's all.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.420
Come on, let's drink.

Mr. Nie, Happy Chinese New Year.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.420
Shengyuan sent a Deputy GM over

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.080
to Shuangyuan a while ago.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.720
I didn't pay much attention to
who it was.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.659
Check his background,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.659
both professional

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.780
and

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.920
personal.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.340
See if he's got any dirt on him.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.280
Got it, Mr. Nie.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.159
I'll check

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.920
after the holidays.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.440
Don't wait.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.560
Do it now.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.440
Yes, sir.

Chengyuan, we've finished.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.720
Let's go grab dinner.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.840
Skip the dinner
and head straight back to Wuxi.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.580
Hello, Mr. Nie.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.920
I was just going to ask

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.920
if you wanted to eat at home.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.140
You've eaten out so much
over the holidays.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.380
A simple home-cooked meal
is the most comforting.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.920
I'll make you a bowl of noodles

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.280
with a fried egg

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.580
and some greens.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.540
But you can't just lie down

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.900
the moment you get home.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.240
I bought you

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.680
a ton of clothes and shoes,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.580
and you're going to try them all on.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.200
It's not like they don't have

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.140
these brands in Wuxi.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.060
Why go through the trouble

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.080
of buying them in Shanghai?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.420
Wuxi doesn't have nearly
as much variety as Shanghai.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.520
I wanted to pick out the best for you.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.640
Once Chinese New Year is over,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.400
you'll be busy with endless meetings

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.480
and banquets.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.260
You're attending

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.680
Old Mr. Sheng's
birthday banquet later, right?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.640
Shanghai people
are all about status and style.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.260
We have to wear

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.580
the latest collections.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.520
Oh, by the way,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.300
Nianyuan bought you

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.300
a gift

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.300
with the money she earned herself.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.020
Money she earned herself?

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.860
Yeah.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.180
She's been learning about investment

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.520
and business from a friend

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.460
and made a bit of a return.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.520
She's been wanting to thank you.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.600
She says spending more time with you

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.700
was a real eye-opener

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.240
and she's picked up a few things.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.320
Which friend?

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.300
What kind of business?

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.360
A friend in Suzhou.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.020
Her family owns a factory,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.300
and she opened a boutique.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.060
I put tens of thousands
into her boutique,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.260
and now I'm getting
a monthly payout of a few grand.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.140
It's fine for a girl
to run a little shop.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.640
But small businesses

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.100
don't make money easily,

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.920
so don't throw it away.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.180
I have everything I need.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.240
If it weren't

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.300
for your connections, Mr. Nie,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.320
I never would've met these people.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.740
So of course

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.740
I need to thank you.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.420
It's her way of showing thanks,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.580
so stop turning her down.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.580
We picked out

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.080
these cufflinks together.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.280
You must wear them
in the birthday banquet.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.020
From Nianyuan's example,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.760
I've realized

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.100
just how much

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.140
networking

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.520
really matters.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.640
People who aren't

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.760
on your level

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.920
simply don't get

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.700
these kinds of opportunities.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.300
Chengyuan,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.680
if you get the chance,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.000
take Nianyuan under your wing more often

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.320
so she can broaden her horizons

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.940
and make more connections.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.300
What?

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.640
Nianyuan wants to go to Old Sheng's

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.800
birthday banquet with me?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.380
I don't.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.900
I was just thinking out loud.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.520
Don't read too much into it.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.640
You've always been

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.480
calculating since childhood.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.200
But

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.200
thanks to that,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.300
otherwise,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.420
how would you have made such a fortune?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.419
With all this stuff you bought me,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.299
did you use up the money

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.679
I sent you last time?

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.300
It doesn't matter.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.700
I don't have much to spend it on anyway.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.080
I'll send you some more.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.140
Give some to Nianyuan, too.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.460
It's embarrassing

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.100
to invest just a few thousand

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.420
in her friend's shop.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.240
Looks cheap and makes me lose face.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.600
You're right.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.040
Nianyuan is a good girl.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.960
She wouldn't dare

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.080
to use your name for clout out there.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.360
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.860
Sorry I'm late.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.000
Happy Chinese New Year.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.020
I went to Changbai Mountain

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.860
over the holidays

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.920
and brought back

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.240
some local snacks for everyone.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.540
You went all the way there

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.040
for the holidays?

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.100
I went with my family.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.680
Was it fun?

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.680
Fun, but freezing.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.260
It was
minus 20-something degrees Celsius.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.360
So, Nie,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.520
what's Mr. Lin's take

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.300
on the proposal?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.360
I sent him both options

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.360
before the holidays,

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.420
along with a pros and cons list.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.020
He's all

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.480
for taking on the challenge

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.200
and building

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.080
a flagship BIPV project.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.160
Mr. Lin certainly has vision.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.040
However,

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.720
our initial designs

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.840
were just for preliminary estimates

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.900
and are still quite rough.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.860
We need

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.080
to finalize

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.920
the main architectural plans first.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.340
Mr. Hua, can your team

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.340
sync with us

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400
and provide

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:17.960
the PV solution?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.080
We need it

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.280
to finalize a precise budget.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.300
The budget...

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.260
What if the final numbers

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.040
are a bit higher?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.360
The boss won't get cold feet,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.540
will he?

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.020
Mr. Lin

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.160
isn't that faint-hearted.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.840
Plus, I'll be working

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.720
with you all

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.900
to keep costs

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.920
within a reasonable range.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.700
That's a relief.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.140
Don't worry.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.780
Mr. Lin is a visionary.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.040
He sees the huge potential

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.920
for BIPV

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.860
and won't be deterred

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.400
by a few hurdles.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.480
He said

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.780
that even if we don't know

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.360
when the market will truly take off,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.260
tech breakthroughs

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.540
don't happen overnight.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.100
Regardless of where the future lies,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.420
we should just dive in

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.480
and start figuring it out.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.600
What else did I say?

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.800
You also said

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.460
that we'd sell our products

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.540
to the Middle East,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.360
and that we'd build
massive BIPV projects

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.100
across the deserts of the oil kingdoms

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.640
and they'd all be "Made in China."

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.140
When on earth

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.200
did I say any of that?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.040
You said in a meeting once

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.800
that we shouldn't just limit
our focus to Europe and the US.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.360
We need to look at the growing demand

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.040
in Asia, Latin America,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.660
and Africa.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.220
So I figured,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.580
since you guys are always talking

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.720
about a "Northwest Strategy,"

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.200
and the Middle East is full of deserts

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.900
and intense sunlight,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.220
it's the perfect fit for this project.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.360
I'm just connecting the dots

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.760
and summarizing.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.340
Aren't you glad

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.460
I'm giving you credit

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.660
for such visionary words?

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.360
That's called selling a pipe dream.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.600
I call it boosting morale

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.860
and getting the team fired up.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.760
Over the holidays,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.780
I consulted my mom

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840
about some funding issues.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.540
She gave me

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.340
a few ideas

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:06.780
I want to look into.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.400
Would you mind putting in a word

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.280
with the heads of Logistics,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.520
Procurement, and Finance for me,

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.100
Mr. Lin?

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.660
Sure.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.200
I'll talk to them in a bit.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.920
No.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.340
Do it now.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.160
You are a procrastinator.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.220
You said you'd lend me those books,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.400
and I still haven't seen them.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.220
The books were in Shanghai.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.580
I just brought them back.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.020
Fine. I'll call them now.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.780
Hello, Ms. Chen?

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.460
Regarding the PV garden in the plant...

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.340
Hi, Mr. Tong?

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.040
Hello, Mr. Wu?

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.540
Mission accomplished.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.160
See?

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.340
Why wait?

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.540
It only took a couple minutes.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:52.960
Thanks, Boss.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.520
I'll get to work then.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.480
You don't have to see me out.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.540
Look outside.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.140
Don't you know
there's a department heads' meeting

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.340
this afternoon?

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.860
They weren't all in the same room

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.900
when they picked up, were they?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.860
I wouldn't know that.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.020
Phew. Lucky me.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:27.700
Today

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.460
marks our first work day
of the new year.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.520
First off, Happy Chinese New Year
to everyone.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.900
That's another year under our belts.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.220
The past year

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.360
hasn't been easy for any of us.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.040
But fortunately,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.640
Shuangyuan is still standing.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.960
We're still pushing forward
against the wind.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.720
The progress

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.480
of our Phase II plant

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.700
has been even smoother than expected.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.580
Mr. Ding,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:50.840
we should be ready

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.100
for the final inspection
by the end of March, right?

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:52.780
Yes.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.300
The civil engineering
is in the finishing stages.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.460
We'll be entering the inspection process
very soon.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.140
We just confirmed

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.340
with the equipment suppliers

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.540
this morning.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.860
Everything will be delivered
on schedule.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.300
If all goes well,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.960
after the line commissioning,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.600
the new facility

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.100
will be in production by May.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.420
Everyone, stay confident.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.900
The domestic market,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.480
especially the power station projects
in Northwest China,

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.780
remains

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.020
our primary focus.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.160
Furthermore,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.340
we must stay committed

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.540
to our brand strategy.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.080
Couldn't you just have brought the books

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.040
to the office?

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.100
And you had to make me
come all the way here?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.900
I brought a ton of books back.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.280
Why not take your pick?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.640
Maybe I should set

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.540
a ground rule:

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.160
you can only borrow two at a time.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.960
Finish those, then come back for more.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.040
Fine, I'll just go
to the Suzhou Library then.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.760
They aren't as stingy as you.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.400
Wow, you bought a lot of books.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.100
I actually bought way more,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.720
but the quality was all over the place.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.720
These are just the ones
that made the cut.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.860
You've read all of these?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.760
I'm a fast reader.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.960
I've given them all a once-over.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.380
Oh, you even have memoirs
from those PV entrepreneurs.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.220
Well, they're bound
to be a bit sugar-coated,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.300
but these guys are the winners

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.220
who came out on top

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.340
during the last wave.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.700
Looking back at the ups and downs

of the PV industry over the last decade

Yes.

to be incredibly painful.

It doesn't hurt now.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.660
It did at first, though.

Sometimes,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.060

Lin Yusen?

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.060
You're having dinner with him tonight?

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:55.700
Are you two

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.420
actually a thing now?

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.000
This isn't happening.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:58.900
Break it off with him, right now.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.360
I'm transferring you

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.080
to another company immediately.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.280
First off, keep your hands

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:06.860
off my phone.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.100
Who I'm with

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.060
is my business.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.480
And I'm not big
on being told what to do.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.780
What do you mean "your business"?

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.600
You're my daughter.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.720
My only daughter.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.660
Mom has legal custody of me.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.260
I know you're mad at me.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.740
But you're my daughter.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.100
Do you really think
I'd ever try to hurt you?

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.580
You're young and naive.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.220
You don't realize
how cutthroat people can be.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.160
Do you have any idea

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.680
how many people
are eyeing your inheritance?

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.040
What's that supposed to mean?

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.060
That anyone who likes me

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.480
is only after my money?

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.800
That's not what I meant.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.920
But it pays to be cautious.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.820
You're overthinking it.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.500
Lin Yusen isn't like that.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.000
Besides, he's already loaded.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.000
He's loaded?

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:55.940
Since when?

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.260
He's just Sheng Xianmin's grandson

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.520
without inheritance rights.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.220
He used to be

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:05.940
a renowned surgeon.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.600
And now, he's a top executive

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.440
at the very least.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.020
So what if he doesn't have
inheritance rights?

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.820
He has more than enough.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.000
Lin Yusen isn't the type to be driven

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:13.820
by blind ambition.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.540
Not ambitious?

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.000
Trust me, there isn't a single person

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:19.760
in that Sheng family

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760
who isn't a shark.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.940
Some just lack the talent,

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.420
and others just lack the luck.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.180
Lin Yusen didn't have the luck,

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.440
but you do.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.400
Since he joined Shengyuan,

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.320
you wouldn't believe how many times

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.340
he tried to cross me.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.560
Even at his age, he managed

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.860
to make things difficult for me.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:36.700
Xiguang,

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.640
you're no match for him.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.200
He'll play you like a fiddle,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.360
and you'll thank him for it.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.820
I've been in this game for years.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.040
Do you really think my judgment is off?

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.160
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.240
with a stone-cold heart.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.240
You aren't even

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.620
in the same league as him.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.560
You think he's actually content

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.440
just rotting away in Suzhou?

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.460
He's playing the long game,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.400
just biding his time.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.060
And now he's using you

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.640
as a stepping stone.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.260
That's on me. I dropped the ball.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.760
I knew

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.160
he had left Shengyuan HQ,

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.800
but I didn't bother
to keep tabs on him after that.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:07.940
Wait,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:08.960
Xiguang,

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.260
he's coming straight for you!

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.300
Cut it out.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.520
Basically, your whole point

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.820
is that he's not into me,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.940
but your money, right?

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.720
Are you trying to trash
Lin Yusen's reputation,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820
or are you just insulting me?

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.200
But

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.520
if he really is with me

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.980
because of your fortune,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.160
doesn't that make us

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:27.920
even more "unbreakable"

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.220
rather than if he just liked my looks

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.140
or my personality?

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.320
After all, in your world, Cash is King,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.620
forever and ever.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.040
Look, there's something
I wasn't going to say.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.800
I didn't want to hurt you.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.020
He used to

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.100
go after Nianyuan.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:02.660
Two years ago,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.800
around this time.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.440
You were

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.560
at Ms. Yu's party too,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.540
but you threw a tantrum and left early,

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.680
remember?

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.840
He was with Sheng Xianmin.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.000
After the party,

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.280
he told people

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.040
he was interested in Nianyuan.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.700
When Nianyuan found out,

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.820
she invited him to Wuxi
to enjoy the plum blossoms.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.040
And he ended up in that car crash

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.320
on his way there.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.020
If Nianyuan

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.260
hadn't told me herself,

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.900
I never would have known.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:36.880
Xiguang,

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.160
do you see it now?

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.920
He's just chasing whatever benefits

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.340
our family can give him.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.460
Ma Nianyuan

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.660
is just a girl

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.340
from the family I'm close with.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.340
And even then, he was all over her.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.780
Imagine what he'll do for you.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.540
You're my flesh and blood.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.120
I don't believe that.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.280
Miss, we've arrived.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:32.780
Miss?

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.220
We're here.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.900
Here you go. Thanks.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.440
Didn't I say I'd pick you guys up?

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.000
Why'd you come all this way on your own?

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.700
Don't tell me you're here early
to check out the restaurant?

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.440
The restaurant
might not even be open yet,

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.260
but we can head over

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.140
and walk around the area.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:26.940
Lin Yusen,

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.420
there's something I need to ask you.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.520
What is it?

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.340
I just met

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440
with my dad.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.840
He said you...

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:56.820
Mr. Nie?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.460
He's in Suzhou?

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.700
What did he say about me?

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.720
Do you know Ma Nianyuan?

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.180
Who is that?

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.660
So you really don't know her.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:19.900
But

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.320
why would Dad tell a lie

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.480
that's so easily exposed?

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:24.800
By that same logic,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.260
Lin Yusen wouldn't bother

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.020
with a useless deception either.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.180
Something's not adding up.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:31.700
Mr. Nie said

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.560
I knew her?

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.640
Well, that's strange.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.680
It is.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.280
You've heard the stories

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.220
about my dad, right?

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.140
You mean...?

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.800
I've heard a thing or two.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.400
Well,

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.600
Ma Nianyuan

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.320
is essentially my father's goddaughter.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.680
Dad said

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.420
you two met two winters ago

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.900
at Ms. Yu's banquet.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.540
And then, she invited you

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.540
to Wuxi to enjoy the plum blossoms.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:23.920
What did you say?

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.780
So, the person who asked me
to Wuxi wasn't you?

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.440
How could it have been me?

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.820
I didn't even know you

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.840
back then.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.060
Two years ago,

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:47.720
in January.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.020
We met

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:49.860
at Ms. Yu's banquet.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:50.920
I went with my grandpa.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.660
Think carefully.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.740
Do you really have
no memory of it at all?

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.340
Did we?

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.159
So that's how it was.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.020
Are you back in the country?

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.080
Where are you now?

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.620
I'm heading there right now.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.280
Come with me.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.740
Where to?

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:03.640
Songjiang.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.560
Come out.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:33.940
Vincent.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.820
You should've told me you were coming.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.340
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.780
Shao Jiaqi?

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:40.700
Nie Xiguang?

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.580
What are you doing here

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.300
with Yusen?

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.420
Shao Jiaqi.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.080
Two years ago,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.660
right before my car accident,

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.000
did you call

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.820
and ask me

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.180
to go to Wuxi?

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.060
Why are you bringing this up again?

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.780
It was all my fault.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.460
I know.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.840
Now, I want you to repeat

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.420
exactly what you said to me

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:04.820
on the phone that day.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.120
My goodness,

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.400
buddy, give me a break.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.560
I already said I was sorry.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.460
If I'd known that woman

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.120
had such low class,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.260
I never would've set you up.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.400
I've already cut ties with her.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:14.860
I told her

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.560
you were in a car accident,

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.220
and she didn't even bother
to check on you.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:16.760
That's enough.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.620
Just repeat what you said,

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.280
word for word.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.120
How am I supposed to remember?

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:33.580
Fine.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.220
I'll say it.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.400
You just confirm if I've got it right.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.120
That day,

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.820
I had just finished a major surgery.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.220
You called and said:

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:44.780
"Come to Wuxi.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.540
I'll introduce a girl to you."

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.280
And I said:

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.420
"You still have the mood for that?

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.800
Thanks, but no need."

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.600
Is that how it went?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.100
Yusen, your memory is incredible.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.380
That's exactly how it went.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.120
It's not my memory.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.440
After the accident,

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.240
as I lay in that hospital bed,
unable to move,

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.160
I replayed those words in my head
like a thousand times.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.120
Then you said:

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.950
"Last week you came

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:15.800
to my mom's party.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.600
That beauty fell for you at first sight.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.440
I ran into her today.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.300
She brought you up

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.160
and invited you to Wuxi
to enjoy the plum blossoms.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:25.880
She's stunning.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.400
Trust me.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.060
Nie Chengyuan's daughter."

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.080
Right.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.340
I'd just returned the country back then.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.160
That woman acted
all pathetic and helpless,

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.460
so she totally misled me.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.220
I actually thought

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.080
she was Mr. Nie's illegitimate daughter.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.880
I only found out

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.620
the truth recently.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.080
And I've been debating

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.320
whether to bring it up to you again.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:06.280
My goodness.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.380
How did you two even end up together?

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.720
Wait, you didn't actually think
the one inviting you

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.480
was Nie Xiguang, did you?

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.040
Wait,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:11.880
did you take it out

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.620
on her?

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.160
Let me take you home.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.540
[To Yin Jie: Sorry, I have to
cancel dinner tonight.]

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.440
[What? What's wrong?]

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.420
[Sorry, please let Yuhua know too.]

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.720
[No worries.
Just make it up another day.]

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.940
[Alright.]

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.140
Sorry

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.600
for what I did to you.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.360
It's okay.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.220
I think

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.460
I need some time alone.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:41.680
