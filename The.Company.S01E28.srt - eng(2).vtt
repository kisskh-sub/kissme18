=Season 1=

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.760
Su?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.480
You want to enter Tianguang Market?

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.640
I want to ask you

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.120
how you got in back then?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.199
(I had failed)

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.759
(the China Academy of Art exam)

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.960
(three times.)

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:14.630
(I was drinking by the river.)

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.120
(I passed out without realizing it.)

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.639
(When I woke up,
I was in the Tianguang Market.)

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.159
It was right here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.711
So this river has to be one
of the gateways into the market.

00:02:29.777 --> 00:02:30.844
Keep this for me.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.479
Su.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.439
Su!

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.039
I'm still here.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.800
Are you sure it was this river?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.919
Yes.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.080
But it wasn't in the water.
It was on the bank.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.599
Why didn't you say so?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240
Come up. We'll figure it out together.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.680
Dry yourself off.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.120
Don't catch a cold.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.599
Lan told me that she wandered

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.919
into Tianguang Market

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.479
after getting lost in the hills.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.319
So there must be more than one entrance.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.879
Don't lose hope yet.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.240
I'm not giving up.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.560
I just don't have

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.759
any other ideas right now.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.400
If I told anyone else this,

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.199
they'd think I was crazy.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.199
A lot of answers

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:50.960
are already there.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.439
It's just not the time
to uncover them yet.

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.439
We'll find a way.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.159
Thanks, Lu Feng.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.240
You can do this.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.439
Just like I did

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.919
when I believed I'd see Lan again.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.759
I hope you're not upset

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.000
that I called you back.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.240
Hall Master.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.879
Did something happen?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.560
The Time Administration has
been following us.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.720
The 25th-century vault

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.879
is off limits for now.

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.720
I assume you know why.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.759
Someone betrayed Fusheng Hall.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.720
One of our own.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.360
You already know who it is, don't you?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.000
Bring her in.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.959
Miss Ye,

00:04:59.044 --> 00:05:00.430
this is all a misunderstanding.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.300
Please, you have to...

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.639
You leaked the coordinates
of our vault to an outsider.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:06.879
Didn't you?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.360
I didn't.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.480
No.

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:20.830
I didn't know he was
with the Time Administration.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.079
I had no idea...

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.920
Take her away.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:49.519
You're much more decisive

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.959
than you were five years ago.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.279
I apologize.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.519
This was my oversight.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.839
Liangyin,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.389
you joined Fusheng Hall eight years ago

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.000
and have already become a supervisor.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.519
Do you know why I trust you so much?

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.560
You're meticulous and level-headed

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.240
in how you handle things.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.920
Above all,

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.439
you're obsessed with these artifacts
in a way few others are.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.000
I hope you keep pushing forward.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:22.360
And don't forget the lessons
you learned.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.680
(Eight Years Ago)

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.680
Thank you.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.600
(Shiyi, Head of the Fusheng Hall
Operations Unit)

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.279
Miss Ye.

00:06:59.066 --> 00:06:59.870
Please have a seat.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.839
Thank you.

00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:06.222
We've reviewed your resume.

00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:07.822
We're pleased with what we've seen.

00:07:08.777 --> 00:07:10.533
The Hall Master can't appear in person,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.377
but he strongly wants you
to join in Fusheng Hall.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.600
Do you really

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.839
have those artifacts?

00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:23.630
Far more than that.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.839
But

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:38.360
these are all holograms.

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.240
Where are the real artifacts?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.600
What you see is only part of it.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:47.000
The physical artifacts are stored
in Fusheng Hall's vaults.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.319
Those vaults

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.600
are scattered
across different timelines.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.800
To keep them hidden,

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.600
each artifact has
its own set of coordinates.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.040
But responsibilities within Fusheng Hall
are strictly divided.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.759
Those coordinates are classified.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:01.680
Even I'm not made privy

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.800
to them.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:11.980
(Two-eared Bronze Cauldron)

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:16.519
A fleeting life

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.319
can be eternal.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.199
These artifacts deserve more
than being lost to history.

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:25.959
They deserve to be given
a rightful place.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.199
I trust

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.000
a professional researcher like you

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.279
will one day

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.240
realize your ideals.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.620
(Four Years Later)

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.320
Ye Liangyin,

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.879
you're now
Head of the Planning Division.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.960
You'll oversee task planning

00:08:55.866 --> 00:08:57.510
and the time-space vaults going forward.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.600
You carry great responsibilities.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:03.080
You've done well these past few years,

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.440
but I must remind you

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.679
that not interfering with history
is the foundation of Fusheng Hall.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.720
Understood.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.399
This mission is dangerous.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:27.879
Be careful.

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.919
Put it into the vault.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.000
All right.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.820
(Huayang City)

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:12.559
Operatives don't
have the clearance to...

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:13.279
It's fine.

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:17.960
Do you trust me?

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.155
(Zi of Fusheng Hall Planning Division)
Yes.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.360
Then you can trust him, too.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.500
(Year 3085-2005)

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.780
(Huayang City)

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.000
Hall Master.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.759
How's the search going?

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.720
We've recovered the Jinyang Square Zun

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:53.960
from Huayang vault.

00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:57.250
We've also located the coordinates
for the Bronze Bells of Shang and Zhou.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:59.120
I'll handle the Dushan Jade myself.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.244
I've informed them

00:11:00.288 --> 00:11:02.960
that we'll no longer be utilizing
the Huayang vault in 2005.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.555
They'll clean it up as soon as possible.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.360
Have you figured out who did it?

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:09.030
We're still investigating.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.399
Don't bother.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:12.279
It was one of our own.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.240
Your weapon

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.519
won't work in the 21st century.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.039
There's a gun in the glove compartment.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.360
I trust

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:24.639
you'll make the right choice.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.080
(Is it him?)

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.639
(Did he really do it?)

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.600
Liangyin.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.519
It really was you.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.200
Why?

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:13.320
Why?

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.559
All these years,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.080
every mission I've done

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.759
has risked my life.

00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:23.222
And what did Fusheng Hall give me?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.120
That little bit of money.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.360
It's not worth dying for.

00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:31.600
I sold

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.320
the Dushan Jade here

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:37.720
and made a fortune.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.399
And I took it back myself.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.799
In 2028,

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:44.399
I have buyers

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.399
willing to pay

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:48.320
even more for it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.679
You'd do anything for money?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.960
Do you realize this will draw
the Time Administration's attention?

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.480
Fusheng Hall will be exposed.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:01.279
As if Fusheng Hall is any better.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.320
You exploited my trust

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:06.799
and stole the coordinates
of the 2005 vault.

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:08.399
You're out of this,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.840
but have you thought about
what Hall Master will do to me?

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:19.279
Liangyin,

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:20.879
listen to me.

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:23.679
Come with me.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.120
The two of us

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.320
can leave Fusheng Hall together.

00:13:27.355 --> 00:13:29.155
I've sold most of the other goods I took

00:13:29.155 --> 00:13:29.750
from the vault.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.911
No matter which era we go to,

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:32.030
we'll survive just fine.

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:33.159
We'll be happy.

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:33.960
Trust me.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.200
It's too late.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.519
Hall Master already knows.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.759
I don't care whether he knows

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:45.960
or not.

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.000
I just want to know

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.559
what you think.

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:00.320
I want you to come back with me.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:10.559
Shiyi.

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:13.919
Return the items,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.279
and I'll speak on your behalf.

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.240
I can make up for the rest, too.

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.240
If we run together,

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.639
we won't get away.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.759
You listen to me!

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:26.000
I've gone this far!

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.440
I never planned on going back!

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.759
Do you understand?

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:47.559
Do it.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.879
You should leave.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.240
I can't give up my dreams.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.240
If this is what you want,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.799
I'll do as you ask.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.360
Miss Ye.

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:21.879
It's been taken care of.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.120
Is there anything else?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.400
We haven't been able to crack

00:16:25.422 --> 00:16:26.890
the garbled coordinates for Yashe yet.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:27.960
It seems to be a place

00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:29.910
with no readable coordinates at all.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.919
That makes sense.

00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:37.600
That place never had coordinates

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.679
to begin with.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.919
How did I not realize it before?

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.440
Where is it?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.240
Have you heard

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.600
of a time rift?

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.160
Chu Qiu.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.039
Chu Qiu!

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.119
Market Lord.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.720
Mr. Chu still hasn't returned.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:19.799
He meant it

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:21.200
when he said he was leaving.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.680
Market Lord.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.599
You're awake.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.319
How are your injuries?

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:35.960
Much better now.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.880
Leave us.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.400
Yes.

00:17:40.266 --> 00:17:41.830
I'm sorry about this, Market Lord.

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:43.920
Spare me the courtesies.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.519
We're friends. You've been good to me.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.920
I couldn't just watch you die.

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.790
I shouldn't have come back
to the Tianguang Market.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.640
Alas,

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:53.839
I had nowhere left to turn.

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:55.200
What happened?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.559
Who did this to you?

00:17:59.977 --> 00:18:01.510
After the Treasure Trove artifacts

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.680
were placed in the Tianguang Market,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.480
I thought everything was finally over.

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:09.440
Turns out it wasn't.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.880
What do you mean?

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.640
If the past didn't happen

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:17.079
the way we thought,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.920
and if someone's death in the past

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:23.880
was caused by some interference
from the future,

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.920
then shouldn't that past be corrected?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.480
Did you discover something?

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:37.119
I'm not sure.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.711
Do the Commissioners
of the Time Administration

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.240
have an alarm device

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.880
that works in any timeline?

00:18:46.977 --> 00:18:48.160
Some kind of emergency device

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.680
that summons reinforcements?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400
That's right.

00:18:52.622 --> 00:18:53.720
But I don't have one.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.822
Chu Qiu should, though.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.680
That said,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.160
the Tianguang Market is a time rift.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.640
Those devices don't work here.

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.000
I understand.

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:06.759
There are other ways to alert
the Time Administration.

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:08.359
If you need it, I can help you.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.759
The time isn't right yet.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.319
When it is,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.599
I'll let them know.

00:19:15.079 --> 00:19:16.440
What I have isn't

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.559
sufficient proof yet.

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.160
And once

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:21.640
they intervene,

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:23.079
some truths

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.599
will be buried forever.

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:29.240
But that truth matters

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:31.319
to me.

00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:35.680
Is this about your friend?

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.100
Yes.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.839
Please keep this a secret for me.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:44.400
This time,

00:19:45.044 --> 00:19:47.510
I want to investigate
without any ties holding me back.

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:49.400
I don't want
to drag anyone else into this.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.680
Especially not you.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.119
They have weapons

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.880
and a time elevator.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.920
They could charge in at any moment.

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:58.839
They won't find this place.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.000
Stay here and recover before you leave.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480
That silver chain

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.200
looks beautiful on you.

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:11.359
Every time I give you a gift,
you light up with joy.

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:13.880
But I've always sensed

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.319
you don't plan to stay here.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:19.559
If one day

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:21.839
you decide to leave,

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:26.119
I'd give my life to help you.

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:30.599
I could leave anytime

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:32.440
I wanted.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.720
But there's a reason I mustn't.

00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:47.400
We're here.

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:50.559
Come in.

00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:04.839
What do you think?

00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:07.880
I never imagined Luoxia Manor

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.480
had a place like this.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.000
Luoxia Manor was Chu Qiu's work.

00:21:13.266 --> 00:21:14.240
This is the only part

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.400
I built myself.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.119
Don't tell Chu Qiu about it.

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:19.799
He doesn't know this place.

00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:21.480
All right.

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:23.920
Look.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.440
These are gifts

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:29.279
from my parents.

00:21:31.488 --> 00:21:33.350
This longevity lock
was a gift from them, too.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.799
I never thought

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.920
I'd actually live this long.

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:40.200
Your mother

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.119
gave you this lock?

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.839
You're not from the future?

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.640
You're from the past.

00:21:53.519 --> 00:21:55.559
How did you end up
at the Tianguang Market?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.759
My home was deep in the mountains,

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.790
in a place known as the Miao Village.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.759
My father was a woodworker.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.519
My mother was an apothecary.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.380
(Miao Village)

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:13.279
Miao Tong, you're back.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:13.920
Yes.

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:15.359
Miao Tong.

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:16.400
Sir. Ma'am.

00:22:16.555 --> 00:22:18.270
Looks like you picked
a lot of mushrooms.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.559
I did. There are plenty more down
by the foothills.

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:21.519
You should go pick some.

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:21.920
All right.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.359
Oh, please pass our thanks
to your mother.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.319
Our child's doing much better.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.160
I will.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.839
You're welcome.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.119
This is

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:35.359
vital purging croton.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.519
And this is

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.799
purging croton.

00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:40.400
They're great for injuries and sprains.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.119
This is

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.240
a false morel.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.200
It's toxic.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.319
You mustn't consume it.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.640
Clan Elder.

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:50.839
This looks a lot like false morel.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.160
But true morels are delicious.

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:56.200
Miao Tong.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.079
Where's your mother?

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:57.960
Is she back yet?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.240
I don't know.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:00.720
She might already be home.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.920
I'll go check.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.720
Miao Tong, things haven't been peaceful

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.019
in the mountains at night lately.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.200
Tell your mother to make sure
she's back before sunset.

00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:11.559
I will.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.799
And this is...

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.759
Father.

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:21.400
When will the swing be ready?

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:22.799
Soon.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.559
I'll have it ready before dark.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.720
Has my mother not returned yet?

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.839
Madam Ru's child fell ill.

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:30.440
Your mother's treating the patient.

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:38.799
Tong.

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:39.799
Mother.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.039
You're finally home!

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:42.759
Welcome back.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:43.830
You must be tired.

00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:44.440
I'll take that.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.160
I'm fine.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.279
I'll make us dinner.

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:49.039
All right.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:49.960
Have a seat, Mother.

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:51.200
That's a lot of mushrooms.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.880
Yes.

00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:54.599
Mother.

00:23:55.079 --> 00:23:56.960
The Clan Elder told me

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.359
the mountains have been restless
at night lately.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.640
You should be careful.

00:24:00.733 --> 00:24:03.955
There have been reports of activity near
an ancient tomb from the last dynasty.

00:24:03.977 --> 00:24:05.260
They're even saying it's haunted.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.680
There are no ghosts or spirits
in this world.

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:09.039
There's nothing to fear.

00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:11.640
If that's true,

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:12.440
how about

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.319
taking me to see it for myself?

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:17.480
Maybe someone's trying to loot the tomb.

00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:24.110
Watch your step.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.044
- All right.
- Here.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:28.440
Here.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.160
Wait. I'll go first.

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:34.640
Come, Tong.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.466
I can do it myself.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.039
Be careful.

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:48.720
That's strange.

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.200
What's the matter?

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.000
I thought the disturbance
at the tomb was caused by herb thieves.

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.319
But these high-grade pink knotweed

00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:57.240
and gentian roots

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.079
are still here, untouched.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.440
Any thief would've

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:03.480
taken these.

00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:04.640
Mother.

00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:05.480
Look!

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.319
Lingzhi!

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:09.640
Slow down.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.039
Careful.

00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:26.311
(They didn't even take something
as valuable as lingzhi.)

00:25:34.279 --> 00:25:35.200
Up ahead

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.666
is where the ancient tomb
from the previous dynasty is.

00:25:38.319 --> 00:25:39.039
Tong,

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:41.079
you stay here and harvest the lingzhi.

00:25:41.088 --> 00:25:42.240
I'll go take a look up front.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.079
I want to go too.

00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:43.599
Do as I say.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.119
Wait here and don't move.

00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:46.319
I'll be back soon.

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:25.559
Mother!

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.160
Mother, where are you?

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.920
Mother!

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:30.759
I'm scared...

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.519
Mother?

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:26.599
Mother?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.720
Mother, where are you?

00:27:52.822 --> 00:27:55.666
(That was the first time
I ever entered the Tianguang Market.)

00:27:57.359 --> 00:27:58.839
(I don't know how much time passed.)

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.359
(One day, I realized that)

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:04.319
(when the mist rose,)

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:06.440
(a path appeared)

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.839
(guiding me forward.)

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:10.920
Mother!

00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:13.920
When I woke up,

00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:16.480
I was in a place I'd never seen before.

00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:18.440
That was where

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.519
I met Chu Qiu.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.839
At the time,

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:24.519
I thought he was a deity.

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.000
I had no idea

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.119
I'd passed through
the Tianguang Market's entrance

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:31.480
and arrived in the 31st century.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.119
Are you

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.200
a deity?

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:01.640
Where did you come from?

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.839
Please save me.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.519
I'm lost.

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:06.720
I want to go home.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.960
How did you get here?

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.240
I live in Miao Village.

00:29:11.759 --> 00:29:14.319
My mother and I were gathering herbs
near the ancient tomb.

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:16.039
She disappeared,

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:17.599
so I went looking for her.

00:29:18.359 --> 00:29:20.279
I think I tripped and fell.

00:29:20.599 --> 00:29:22.480
After that,
I ended up somewhere strange.

00:29:22.839 --> 00:29:23.799
It was filled

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:24.920
with mist.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.039
The sky glowed red like sunset.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.039
There was

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.920
a red tree.

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:34.160
And a very long river.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.000
I kept walking along that river,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.440
and somehow I ended up here.

00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:40.880
You've been to the Tianguang Market?

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:43.119
What's the Tianguang Market?

00:29:45.111 --> 00:29:47.333
People who've been there aren't supposed

00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:48.640
to remember it.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.920
Mr. Deity,

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.200
can you send me home?

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:54.799
One moment.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.720
This is the Time Administration.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.039
A girl from a different timeline
was transported here.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.200
It appears to be an accident.

00:30:04.888 --> 00:30:06.822
However,
she's been to the Tianguang Market

00:30:06.822 --> 00:30:08.440
and retains her memories of it.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.720
She wishes to return home.

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:11.720
Please send me the data from her time.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.279
Data transmitted.

00:30:37.244 --> 00:30:38.640
Are you sure you want to go back?

00:30:39.599 --> 00:30:40.599
Yes.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.920
(The Time Administration
treated my injuries)

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:50.240
(and sent me back to Miao Village.)

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.440
(But in the days I was away,)

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.400
(everything changed.)

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.039
Clan Elder!

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.559
What happened here?

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.880
Miao Tong.

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:11.160
Run!

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:13.680
Run as far from the village

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.799
as you can.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.480
Someone disturbed the ancient tomb.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.200
The deities are enraged

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.720
and their wrath has fallen upon us.

00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:25.319
I'll suffer

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.440
any punishment,

00:31:29.519 --> 00:31:31.920
but please spare the young kids.

00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:36.039
Father!

00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:36.680
Mother!

00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:39.039
Mother!

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.000
Father.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.599
Father, what's going on?

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:44.759
Tong, you're back.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.480
Go...

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.960
Leave this place...

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.400
The ancient tomb... The spirits...

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.519
The curse...

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:52.319
You must leave at once...

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.480
I'm not going anywhere.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.400
Father...

00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:56.640
Mother...

00:31:58.599 --> 00:31:59.920
Mother...

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.440
This is all my fault.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.759
I shouldn't have dragged you
to the ancient tomb.

00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:07.519
Mother...

00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:09.640
Mother, wake up.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.480
Mother...

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.480
I was foolish.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.839
I'll take responsibility for what I did.

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:26.559
Please don't punish
my innocent family and fellow villagers.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.720
Father.

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:49.160
Mother.

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.440
I must go now.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.720
You must all live on.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.119
(Miao Village)
(Later, I learned)

00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:34.720
(they weren't deities at all.)

00:33:35.577 --> 00:33:37.480
(They were members
of the Time Administration.)

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.480
(I underwent their training,)

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.240
(came to the Tianguang Market)

00:33:45.266 --> 00:33:46.666
(and became the Market Lord.)

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.839
It's almost unheard of
to retain your memories

00:33:54.911 --> 00:33:56.000
after leaving the market.

00:33:56.799 --> 00:34:00.000
The Time Administration
recognized your potential.

00:34:03.079 --> 00:34:04.920
I do have a good memory.

00:34:06.319 --> 00:34:07.640
After training,

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.800
I could identify the market's portals

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.639
from different eras.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.840
They said this ability only exists

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.119
in time-space analysts.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.960
As far as I know,

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.960
they trained several people like me.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.639
I just want someone to replace me soon.

00:34:24.977 --> 00:34:26.190
You stayed here willingly

00:34:26.599 --> 00:34:27.519
for the sake

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:28.440
of your family

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:30.519
and your people.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.800
That's admirable.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.639
But...

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.760
But what?

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.960
The first and foremost rule

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.760
of the Time Administration

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.639
is never altering the course of history.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.239
Should you

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:56.320
be amenable to this,

00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.510
I'd like to visit your family
on your behalf.

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.960
When and where

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.840
did you live?

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.960
In the Wanqi era,

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:08.599
Zicang County.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.920
Miao Village,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.239
east of Er Mountain.

00:35:13.719 --> 00:35:14.760
I'll remember that.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.159
Thank you for saving me.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800
I'll hide here for a while.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.199
I'll escape on my own

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:22.400
if necessary.

00:35:22.577 --> 00:35:24.044
You need not worry about me.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.719
But...

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.000
Please remember,

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.679
no matter what happens,

00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:33.480
protect yourself first

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.119
and make the right choice.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.960
The purpose of time travel isn't

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.977
to change the past,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.960
but to create

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:42.679
a better future.

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:45.559
As long as you're alive,

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:47.760
there's hope.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.800
Take care.

00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.119
Farewell.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.840
Bizhi!

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:23.360
My name is Miao Tong.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.119
"Tong" as in bright red.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.079
If you ever get the chance,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.400
please visit my parents for me.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.239
Tell them

00:36:35.559 --> 00:36:36.920
I'm doing well.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920
Miao Tong.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.440
A splendid name.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.679
Take care,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.880
Miss Miao Tong.

00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:33.960
Lin Zhong!

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.079
Lin Zhong!

00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:36.679
Lin Zhong!

00:37:36.777 --> 00:37:37.800
You got here before me.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.960
Did you see who stole half my table?

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.244
The other half was about this big

00:37:41.266 --> 00:37:43.030
and this tall.
Just like the one you're on...

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Get down from there!

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.599
Get down!

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:49.320
This table's made from
the root of a thousand-year-old tree!

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.960
Stingy. I'm just borrowing it.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.480
That thing's heavy.
How did you even move it by yourself?

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.559
You're just bad luck for me.

00:37:55.559 --> 00:37:57.760
It's been nothing but disasters
for me today.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.320
Master Dong!

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:00.440
Su Beilu.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.280
I say, you look decent today.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.199
Looking sharp.

00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:03.800
Master Dong.

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.280
I'm desperate.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.400
You've seen the world.

00:38:06.422 --> 00:38:07.590
Can I ask you about a place?

00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:08.360
Go on.

00:38:08.666 --> 00:38:10.360
Have you heard of the Tianguang Market?

00:38:10.559 --> 00:38:11.199
What?

00:38:11.679 --> 00:38:12.559
It's a place

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.360
where time stands still.

00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:15.840
People from different dynasties

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.920
live there.

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:19.199
I know it.

00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:20.719
Come here. Let's sit down and talk.

00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:24.070
That place you're talking about

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:26.000
is a quantum field.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.039
What you're describing

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:30.360
is a time-frozen space that exists

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.960
as a quantum pair

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.400
with the outside.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.199
No...

00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:36.519
You need an observer for that.

00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:37.880
You know John von Neumann?

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.519
No.

00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:39.920
How about quantum entanglement?

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920
No more entanglements!

00:38:42.519 --> 00:38:44.119
There's a river there.

00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:45.719
It's called the River of Oblivion.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.760
There's a big tree by the river.

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:50.039
Red leaves fall from it.

00:38:50.066 --> 00:38:51.550
You've got connections everywhere.

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:52.800
Help me look into it, please?

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.960
You mean this place?

00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:16.440
Who drew this?

00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:18.110
This painting's called

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.155
"The River of Oblivion."

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.066
It was done by a senior of mine
from Huayang Academy of Fine Arts.

00:39:22.222 --> 00:39:23.630
Did she say where this place is?

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.800
No.

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:25.880
She just said

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.880
that when she was a kid,
she once went camping

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:29.239
and a heavy fog rolled in.

00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:30.159
She had a dream.

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:31.719
In the dream, she saw this scene.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.800
When she grew up,

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.840
she painted it.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:35.360
It was foggy.

00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:38.400
When I was about to fall asleep,

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:40.559
I saw layers of mist.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.920
Everything was white.

00:39:42.488 --> 00:39:44.360
That's when I entered
the Tianguang Market.

00:39:45.622 --> 00:39:46.760
So that's how it happened.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.380
Please help me get the address from her.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.360
Master Dong,

00:39:50.519 --> 00:39:50.960
come on!

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.639
Master Dong, drive faster!

00:39:56.639 --> 00:39:57.920
This is as fast as I can go.

00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.669
This car's been acting up lately.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.380
Feels like
it's not getting enough power.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.480
The address Lin Zhong gave us
is too remote.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.750
If we go any farther,
we'll be heading into the mountains.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.079
Why haven't we arrived yet?
