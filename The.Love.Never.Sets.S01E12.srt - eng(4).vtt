WEBVTT

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.400
The freshman named Alex.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.600
He doesn’t have any attendance record

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.320
for any classes except for Prof.Mint's.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.280
Okay then, let’s split up and handle this.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.280
You’re going to Prof.Fah’s house with Book.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.520
As for Sea and Lanee.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.160
And you two?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.760
Ice and I will find a way into Prof.Mint’s room

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.400
and help Alex

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.760
and livestream everything using the same camera

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.720
he uses to record the students.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.120
Good evening, Prof.Mint.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.120
Agh!

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.920
Saint!

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.320
Now everyone will see

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.520
what my last class of the day will look like.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.120
Should I teach a class on murder?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.440
(Elevator out of order - under maintenance)

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.240
You came here to kill me, didn’t you?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.440
And this is all you prepared?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.360
Looks like today

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.600
you’re finally going to get a reunion

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.040
with your brother.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.720
Don’t!

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.000
Ahhh!

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.520
Hey!

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.800
Stop it!

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.960
Yes, officer.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.320
Room 7110.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.720
The hotel I mentioned.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.440
Yes.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.360
I admit to all charges.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.280
Living comfortably isn’t your thing?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.280
Huh?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.320
You want to be a hero?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.720
You want to be a good person?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.640
Hey!

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.520
Then today I’ll teach you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.240
what being a good person really looks like.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.360
Saint!

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.800
Aaaah!

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.000
Agh!

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.720
Saint!

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.400
Saint!

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.560
You ruined my life and that wasn’t enough,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.800
now you go after my boyfriend too?!

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:47.880
Ugh!

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.240
Ugh!

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.600
Saint!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Apologize to my brother!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.600
Ugh!

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.480
I’ll send you to be with my brother.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.000
Alex!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.480
No!

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.680
Alex, stop it!

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.640
Alex, that’s enough!

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.000
Ice, let go of me.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.640
I’m sending him to be with my brother.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.560
Do you think your brother would even

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.800
want him to be with him?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.000
Do you think he would want you in prison, Alex?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.920
Let go of me!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.560
If he dies,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.720
then he won’t have to take responsibility!

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.840
Let him live with the evil he’s done.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.960
That’s the real punishment.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.360
You know that, don’t you, Alex?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.520
Huh?!

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.880
Saint!

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.000
Saint!

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.360
Stop!

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.160
Get down on the ground.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.440
You’re under arrest.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.160
Now!

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.400
Get down!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800
Let go of me! Officer, please help my boyfriend!

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.600
Get down!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600
Let go of me!

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.200
Stay still.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.080
Please wait here for a moment.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.880
I’ll send the medical team in.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.120
Saint.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.400
It’s…

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.280
It’s over now, Ice.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.000
You…

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320
you don’t have to have nightmares anymore.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.400
Mm.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.240
Saint, you have to stay with me.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.120
Saint.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960
Do you remember what you once told me?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.160
That you’d help make my dreams come true,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600
that I could live the life I wanted.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.880
I’ve only just started living my own life.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.920
Please don’t leave me yet.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400
I…

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.840
I love you.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.760
I love you too, Saint.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.760
I’m going to class, okay?

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.520
I’ll be back.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.160
How is Saint doing?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.240
He’s out of danger now,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.280
but he still needs time to recover.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.320
So I came to ask if I could file

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.280
a leave request for Saint,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.560
maybe about two weeks.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.240
Mm.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.960
Don’t worry about it,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.560
I’ll take care of everything.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.560
Now let me tell you some good news.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.280
The university has officially issued

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.680
an apology to you and Saint,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.760
and has revoked all disciplinary actions

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.480
that were previously imposed on both of you.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.080
(Clarification on Disciplinary Action Revision)

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.200
(To: Mr. Karun Thongdee)

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.520
(This is to announce the cancellation)

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.920
(of disciplinary punishment)

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.480
That’s not all.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.120
This part is your scholarship.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.360
The university will

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.400
refund all tuition fees you’ve already paid,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.960
and you’ll receive a full scholarship

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.640
until graduation,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.600
including living expenses.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.520
5,000 baht per month.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.440
Thank you, Professor Sara.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.600
I should tell you

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.000
this was actually the president’s idea.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.520
Mr.Khom?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.039
Yes.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.840
If you’re okay with it…

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.720
just sign here.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.880
Yes.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.720
(Karun Thongdee)

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.480
Thank you.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.360
From now on, I wish you good luck.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.800
Think of this as a reset.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.160
A brand-new start.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.280
May I choose not to start over?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.080
Hm?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.320
I’d rather just keep going.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.640
Alright.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.800
Sure.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Starting over is exhausting, right?

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.040
Yes.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.400
If you need anything, come talk to me.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.240
Or if there’s anything I can help with,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.160
let me know.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.600
Thank you.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.840
I’ll take my leave now.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.800
Let me help.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.800
Ice.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.080
It's fine.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.600
Is this Professor Mint’s stuff?

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.360
They asked me to throw it away.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.520
I’ll carry it for you.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.040
Ice,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.120
you don’t have to do this.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.000
The more you do,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.000
the worse I feel.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.280
After everything I did to you,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.600
let me face my karma myself.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.440
I’m not angry with you at all.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.680
You didn’t know the truth either.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And you were one of the victims too,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.560
tricked by Professor Mint just like me.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.920
It wasn’t only Mint who deceived me.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.840
I deceived myself as well.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.800
Deep down, I knew

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.160
he was lying.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.600
He never truly loved me.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.120
And you didn’t cause me to miscarry.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.640
I was the foolish one.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.520
I believed what he told me,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.200
that I was the greatest blessing in his life,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.160
that I was the person

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.720
he wanted most to be the mother of his child.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.360
Professor,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.880
he was right.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.560
You are someone’s good fortune,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.040
someone lucky to have you as a wife

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.000
or as the mother of their child.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.400
You’re an incredibly capable person.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.680
This must be my karma.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.560
But Mint has to face his karma too.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.320
Now he’s completely alone.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.960
You made me see his true nature.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.800
Thank you so much, Ice.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.480
And I’m truly sorry.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.440
I really am sorry.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.840
Excuse me, nurse.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.360
Yes?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.840
Where did the patient in this room go?

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.640
His family came to take him

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.560
home for continued treatment.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.560
Are you Mr. Ice?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.240
Yes.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.640
Someone left this letter for you.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.720
(12 November 2025)

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.400
(Mr. Karun Thongdee)

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.960
The personal cash check

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.480
I have attached to this letter

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.480
is my apology as university president

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.240
And as a request from me as a father,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.320
stop contacting Saint

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.240
before my son is put in even more danger.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.640
From now on,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.920
you and Saint will no longer meet again.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.760
Mr.Khom,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
do you realize what you’re doing?

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.080
I know exactly what I’m doing.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.120
But do you, Bua?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.320
Do you realize what you’re doing?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.640
Do you remember your duty?

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.000
I do.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.600
But what you’re doing now

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.600
is completely irrational.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.080
How dare you talk back to me?

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.040
Give it to me.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.560
Give it!

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.040
Bua!

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.920
Let go!

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.800
You’ve completely lost your mind.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.720
I can be even crazier!

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.360
Go.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.160
Get out.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.560
Fine.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.440
I won’t tolerate this anymore either.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.360
What do you want?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.000
Why are you here again?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.480
I’m here to see Saint.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.120
Is Saint inside?

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.040
He is.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.960
But you’ll never see him again.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.520
Why?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560
Did you lock him up?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.560
Like last year?

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.880
You want us to break up

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.280
so you can be happy, right?

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.680
I’m Saint’s father.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.520
I have the right to choose what’s best for my son.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.400
So you chose the path that makes him unhappy?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.360
Is this what you call love?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.280
Do you love Saint, or do you only love yourself?

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.720
This is my family matter.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.560
Who are you?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.240
You have no right

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.440
to interfere.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.720
But Saint is my family too.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.720
I’ll stand right here.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.240
I’m not going anywhere

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.320
until I see Saint.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.440
Hmph.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.000
Do whatever you want!!

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.080
Mr.Khom,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.280
I resign.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.520
Since you’re leaving anyway,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.320
drag him out of my sight as well.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.520
Are you sure you’ll be able to stop them?

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.840
What do you mean?

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.600
It's been two years.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.800
Saint has never forgetten Ice.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.520
Saint is serious about Ice.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.360
And when teenagers are serious about each other,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.640
they don’t think things through.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
It only makes things spiral even more.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.680
If they think they can go up against me,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.599
they’re mistaken.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.800
You were young once too, sir.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.200
You should understand them.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.680
Back then, you went against your wife’s family

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.359
just like they are now.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.240
Everyone said your relationship wouldn’t last,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.160
but you proved them wrong.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.079
Didn’t you?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.119
Those kids are shallow.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.880
How would they even understand what real love means?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.720
Ice.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.560
Hello, Pas.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880
I’m here.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:52.960
Okay.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.800
Thank you so much

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.320
for letting me borrow the club’s sound system.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.680
It’s nothing, of course I’d help my junior.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.160
Hang in there, everyone’s cheering you on.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.400
Thank you.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.600
Okay.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.320
I’ll help.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.280
Good luck.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.600
I’m heading off now.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.200
See you.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:25.680
See you.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.720
Drive safely.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.480
Hello.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.720
Today, I’m here to look for my missing heart.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.240
There’s an uncle who stole my lover from me.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.880
If you pass by,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.320
please help by liking, commenting,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.000
and sharing to support me.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.720
Someone once said this song is about a secret crush.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.360
Then let it stay a secret.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.520
Let’s see

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.000
after this song ends,

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.560
how much longer he can keep hiding my love.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.880
(I once went through pain.)

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.320
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.120
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.480
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.280
(It changed the sky that was once dark)

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.880
(into a light that made my heart beat strongly again.)

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.800
(And nobody can ever take your place)

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.560
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.040
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.480
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.120
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.640
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.400
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.400
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.360
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.600
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.240
Mr.Khom?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.400
Mr.Khom?

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.280
Hey.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.000
Saint?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.440
Where are you going?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.000
You're still recovering

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.480
I'm going to go see my boyfriend.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.960
But you're my son

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.360
and I command you to stay here.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.440
Ice.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.320
You..

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:12.920
Saint..

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.720
Are you hurt?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.200
I'm going to call the police

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.680
on you for breaking and entering!

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.840
I'm also going to call the police on you!

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.720
The charge is unlawful confinement of

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.480
your own son for many years,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.120
including domestic violence.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.800
Do you really think

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800
you can win against me?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.760
Even if I don’t win,

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.160
everyone in the university will know

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.560
what kind of father you really are.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.080
Saint.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.320
See that, son?

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.240
How could you fall for someone like this?

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.280
He’s destroying our family.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.200
He is my family.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.480
So you’re choosing him?

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.520
Go on.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.360
Choose.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.440
Arrest me, or send him to the police.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.640
Is this really what you want?

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.120
This can only end in two ways.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.760
The first choice is

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.200
Saint never comes back here again.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.400
The second choice is

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.080
Saint and I choose each other.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.040
In the end,

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.560
no matter how it ends,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.960
isn’t Saint the one who will suffer the most?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.360
Isn’t there any other way

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.200
for someone as good as Saint

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.960
to be happy like everyone else?

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.640
What kind of twisted logic is that?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.720
Bua.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.920
Go call the police and arrest him.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.760
No, sir.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.600
Your wife’s last request

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.720
was for Saint to never lack love.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.520
Now I finally understand

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.400
who truly loves Saint.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.000
If your wife were still alive,

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.760
she would be disappointed in you,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.400
no less than I am right now.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.840
Fine.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.520
For your mother’s sake,

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.760
I’ll give you a chance.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.200
Go wherever you want.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.840
If you want to be together, then go.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.040
But don’t expect me to help you.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.200
I won’t give you a single baht.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.360
If you think you’re so capable,

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.320
if you love each other that much,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.320
then take responsibility for your own lives.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.480
Dad.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.600
Go!

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.320
Leave!

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720
Go now,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.880
before I change my mind!

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.400
Go!

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.080
Thank you, Dad.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.840
Are you okay?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.760
I’ve packed all the important things for you already.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.920
And…

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.680
this too.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.360
Here, I’ll help pack.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.120
Are you alright?

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.640
Ice,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.200
I’ve already lost one parent.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.760
I don’t want to lose my dad too.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.480
Besides you, he’s the only family I have left.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.720
Don’t worry.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.160
We’ll figure it out together.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.680
But right now, you need to get treated first.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.840
He’s old.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.920
I don’t want him to be alone.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.480
Alright.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.600
Thank you for everything, Aunt Bua.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.600
Take care.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.880
Slowly.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.000
Hey.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.880
Here.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.640
Thank you so much.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.120
If it weren’t for you that day,

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.600
I’d probably be dead with my brother by now,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.120
or in prison with Professor Mint.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.520
Now that Professor Mint is gone,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.040
what are you going to do next?

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.280
I’ll probably continue studying communication arts.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.520
But finals are in a few days,

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.920
and I haven’t attended class at all.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.920
If I pass, I stay.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.160
If I fail, I drop out.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.320
Hey.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.720
Then take my summary notes.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.560
I guarantee if you read them all,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.560
you’ll pass.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.640
Damn.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.280
Alright.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.280
And you, stop taking sleeping pills already.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.520
If something’s bothering you,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.760
we’ll take you to heal your heart.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.120
There’s a therapist who’s really good.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.080
You’ll definitely like them.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.320
Hey, is your wound healed yet?

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.560
I still can’t put much strain on it.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.520
But it’s going to leave a scar too.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.280
You can’t exert yourself,

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.880
but you can drink alcohol, right?

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.080
Ahh.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.760
Hey Alex, mix one for him.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.960
Okay. Mix one for yourself too.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.240
I’m waiting to clink glasses together.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.320
Alright.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.240
So,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.640
add a lot of cola for me, okay?

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.000
I’ll make it for you. Hey,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.080
can you place the order?

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.720
Sure.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.440
Hang on a sec.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.960
Hey,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.240
about those summary sheets.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.960
Can you let Mud look at them too?

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.680
I’ll ask Ten to pass them to him.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.200
Mm.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.600
Those two again.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.600
I really want to know,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.840
are you still not back together?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.760
With Mud?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.520
Huh?

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.480
Why does Mud still have to sleep in my room?

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.280
I’m begging you.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.560
Go make up with him already.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.440
You asshole, do you know?

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.560
When he sleeps in my room,

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.960
I’m already losing my mind.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.800
The dorm’s tiny,

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.920
and before sleeping,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.080
he rambles on about god-knows-what

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.400
until three or four in the morning.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.720
And when he finally sleeps,

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.640
he snores.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560
Damn it.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.160
I don’t get any sleep at all.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.200
Hey,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.440
just put up with him a bit.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.440
He’ll grow up eventually.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.320
I had a straight guy mission that

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.480
I need to complete too!

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.760
You get me, right?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.800
I’m repressed, you get me, right?

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.240
Just do it, he won’t say anything.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.880
Normally when he sleeps with me,

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.680
he does it every day anyway.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.120
I’m not shameless like him.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.440
Asshole.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.200
Every time you talk about him, your eyes light up.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.600
Can you stop lying already?

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.560
That you don’t miss him.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.960
Everyone knows already

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.360
that you two can’t live without each other.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.520
If he’s not going to be clear about it,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.760
I think I’d rather cut my losses and just be friends.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400
And how clear does he have to be?

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.120
You…

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.360
Can’t you try being more open-minded?

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.520
I know I’m childish.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.200
That’s why I stopped.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
That’s why I think it’s better to be alone.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.400
No.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.240
What I mean is,

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.880
can you try being more open-minded with yourself?

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.480
Not just suddenly saying, I’m childish.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.880
I’m not good.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.640
I should be alone.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.600
I’m better off single.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.200
If you’re in a relationship,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.840
you have to listen,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.200
adjust, tune things together, right?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.720
Like guitar strings.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.680
Wow.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.280
You’re really good at teaching me today.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280
You don’t have anyone, do you?

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.560
That’s why you can say all this.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.160
I want my peace of mind back.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.520
Asshole.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.800
Just take him to sleep with you already.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.520
I can’t take this anymore.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.000
So, aren’t you getting ready today?

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.440
I’ve got someone filling in for me today.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.760
I guarantee, when you guys see this,

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.200
you’ll be surprised.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.240
Right?

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.960
Toon Bodyslam?

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.720
Even bigger than that.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.720
I wrote a song to make up with my boyfriend.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.600
Where’s your boyfriend, bro?

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.520
Hey, let go of me.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.360
Stop it.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.520
Let go of me.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.280
This is history repeating itself.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.440
Who the hell is this?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.240
He’s my best friend, bro.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.720
And here,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.920
aren’t your customers going to run out of the shop?

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.680
No, they won’t.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.640
I wrote this song especially for you, Book.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.600
And this song is called

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.320
Booked.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.160
Mud, woo!

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.360
Do you still remember?

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.200
We were together.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.720
You asked why we even were.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.600
We fought.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.280
Cried and got hurt.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.520
Everyone left.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:15.760
These days I sleep alone, thinking about you.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.920
Can I go back to you?

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.040
I want to hold you while we sleep.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.440
After today, don’t flirt with me anymore.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.560
Let everyone know at the same time.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.680
My boyfriend’s name is Book.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.000
Let’s get back together.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.560
Please.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.440
Can you stop being mad at me?

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.640
Book,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.680
stop being mad, pleaaase.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.320
I don't know what else to do so that you'll believe me.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.840
I even posted a status.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.320
I even messaged everyone I used to talk to.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.640
Even though I got cursed at and called pathetic,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.120
I still did it.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.960
Because I only love you.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.840
I only miss you.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.200
I only want to sleep holding you.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.400
Can you stop being mad at me?

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.280
Book, I’m begging you!

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:09.760
Can we make up?

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.520
Come back, please. Stop being mad at me.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.760
Let’s make up,

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:16.600
okay?

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:22.600
Yeah.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.639
I’m sorry too.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.760
I finally see how hard you’ve been trying.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.280
I’m the one who never tried at all.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.400
I’m sorry.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.320
So what does that mean?

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.679
It means you can come sleep with me now.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.880
I miss you.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.480
So...

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:47.560
So you’re agreeing to be my boyfriend again, right?

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.280
I never said we broke up.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.080
I picked this just for you.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.920
Is it pretty?

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.360
I really took my time choosing it.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.440
Sit, sit here, quick.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.000
Right this way.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.800
Thank you.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.880
Thank you

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.400
for using my service.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.720
Are you hungry?

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.400
I am.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.600
After fighting for so long,

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.000
is this really how it ends?

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.240
And are you okay with that?

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.560
No, I’m not.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.520
Hold on.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.880
I'm is still in character.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.560
Let me tune out for a sec.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.640
Okay now?

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.200
How was it?

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.120
If I had to suggest something...

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.680
Hey.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.080
Saint shouldn’t know the ending beforehand.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.080
Let him find out on set.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.640
Like Marvel.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.480
Oh.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.920
You could’ve just told me nicely.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.680
No need to tear it up.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.520
You scared me to death.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.240
If I told you first,

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.920
then you’d know in advance.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.240
Do you get what I mean?

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.720
Okay, I get it.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.720
Come on, I’ll pack this up for you.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.400
Thank you.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.000
The movie isn’t even finished filming yet.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.160
Saint and Ice’s fans

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.600
are already asking about the shooting date.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.360
Ah.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.440
I mean, the release date.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.320
Ugh.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.000
I’m stressed.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.080
Don’t be.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.360
At least you can think of it this way.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.320
Everything that happened

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.120
gave your movie free promotion,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.920
not a single baht spent.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.080
That’s true!

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.520
Promotion like no other.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.680
Way too dramatic, right?

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.440
A new style?

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.000
Excuse me, serving your food.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.480
Thank you.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.280
It looks delicious.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.480
You look even more delicious.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.840
Nice atmosphere,

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.000
beautiful person.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.360
With a sweet mouth like that,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.080
come here and give me a kiss.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.600
Close your eyes first.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.800
I have a surprise.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.440
Hmm?

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.440
I’d like to sing this song for our anniversary.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.560
Happy mensiversary, two months.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:29.800
(Do you still remember the day we were in love?)

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:35.640
(I remember every second that I had you.)

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.560
(I still see you so clearly.)

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.400
(All our things are still in the same spot.)

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:53.800
(I now understand who I want in my life.)

00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:01.120
(No matter how long, it's still you.)

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.960
(Everything that's stuck in my heart,)

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.680
(I want to go back in time.)

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.480
On every anniversary.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.800
The person standing next to you,

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.360
will be me.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.720
Thank you so much, my love.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:27.960
(Is it still me that you love?)

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:34.160
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.440
(Because my broken heart still waits for your return.)

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:46.920
(Just like when we were in love, I want to ask,)

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:52.080
(can it still be me that you love?)

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:58.480
(I still hold on to every promise,)

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.200
(my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.520
(Change these cold nights )

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.000
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.280
(That's all I want to ask.)

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.160
What are you doing?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.120
Oh.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.320
You're getting better everyday.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.040
Don't.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.520
Spin for me.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.680
Mud is really bold.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.840
Everyone has their happy ending.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.640
Now it's just us.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.720
What should we do next?

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.840
I think that..

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.120
I'm pretty happy.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.000
Be real with me.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.800
Do you still miss your dad?

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.880
Just hold on a little longer.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.800
I’ll do everything.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.000
So that my dad can't do anything to us anymore.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.360
Even though right now,

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.960
you’re not the billion-baht son-in-law

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.280
of Saeng Aruna yet.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.600
But I’ll make all your dreams

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.160
come true.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.520
Yeah.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.600
I promise you

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.600
that you'll be proud of me.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.960
I'm already proud of you.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.880
I want the kind of relationship you’re truly proud of.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.800
Not just being comfortable when you’re with me.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.080
I want the whole world to be jealous

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.560
that you have me as your boyfriend.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.000
And your dad will have to accept me

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.760
as your childhood sweetheart.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.840
From now on,

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.360
we still have a lot to prove

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.280
before we can go back and face your dad.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.200
So he won’t label me

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.920
as the person who dragged his son away.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.520
We’ve already been through worse than this.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.880
This doesn’t scare me.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.280
You…

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.240
are you ready to be my chaos, fully?

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.960
I’ve never been scared anyway, have I?

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.000
But…

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.120
it’s time to clean up.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.600
I’m scared the wound will get wet.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.240
Help wipe me down.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.080
Didn’t you say it was healed already?

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.720
You don’t want to help?

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.080
Please.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.000
Help me wipe down, okay?

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.720
Then I’ll go get a towel first.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.120
Doing it alone is embarrassing.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.520
No.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.480
No.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.440
You don’t have to hold back.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720
Just do what you want.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.840
The wound might split open.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.440
So what?

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.000
It’s fine.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.400
Okay?

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.720
Don’t get mad later then.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.000
You have successfully grabbed the doll.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.600
Please open the lid to retrieve the doll.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.000
Where? Is the little bear in here?

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.760
I’m seriously asking.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.560
Why do you always get horny in the bathroom?

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.280
People are allowed to have weird preferences, right?

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.680
So when will you invite Saint’s dad to

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.240
have dinner with us?

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.720
I just got him kicked out of his house.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.960
If back then

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.280
I hadn’t agreed to be your roommate,

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.240
Do you think we’d still end up like this today?

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.640
Can I take a picture?
