00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:49.415
Keifer's not going to school today
if he's the one you're looking for.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:50.750
Huh, what do I care about him?

00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:52.817
Besides, Keifer isn't
the one I'm looking for.

00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:54.170
Did that man come here?

00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:55.129
Where's Keiren?

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:55.197
👇Kon Mi Joy Maray 😂 Kon Pin Louch Pek

00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:56.267
Where did you go?

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:58.418
You know dad already
went back to the country.

00:00:58.543 --> 00:01:00.102
Are you Jasper Jean Mariano?

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:02.450
The Watson Family is asking for you.

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:03.454
Are we all complete?

00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:04.834
We need your cooperation.

00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:05.941
Dad is up to something.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:06.948
What's your name?

00:01:06.972 --> 00:01:08.277
Uh, Jasper Jean Mariano, Sir.

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:10.681
Your mom is kind of tactless, isn't she?

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:12.194
They're none of your business.

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:13.701
I'll take full custody of Keiren.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:14.725
Sign these.

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:16.709
I won't sign anything!

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.962
Keiren, go hide!

00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:22.048
Hurry up, Run!

00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:23.072
Beat him up.

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:28.256
Go on, pull that trigger.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.262
Can you really kill a
defenseless student?

00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:31.286
Class is adjourned.

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:32.832
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:35.011
He's a professional hitman!

00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:37.069
What happened between you and your dad.

00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:38.882
Give me back my money!

00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:40.141
You're so greedy!

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.538
So what if that's what he said to Ella too?

00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:58.163
That doesn't mean he's fooling me.

00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:00.320
Aries is so annoying!

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.200
But what if he really
is just playing with me?

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:07.501
No.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.504
Keifer wouldn't do that.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:11.881
He trusts me.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.867
He even told me about what
happened between him and his dad.

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:17.429
So I should trust him too.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.210
Aries already knows about us.

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:03.104
Hello?

00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.392
Are you crying?

00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:07.631
Huh?

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:10.220
Your voice, it sounds different.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.902
Did Aries do something
else to make you cry?

00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:17.213
No.

00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:19.589
He just scolded me.

00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:21.927
I'll beat him up for you.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.466
Stop it.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.248
I'm dead serious, Jay.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.562
I'm with you.

00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:32.093
If I have to face everyone in your family
just to prove that I love you,

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:33.118
I will.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.340
Keifer.

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:37.788
Even if I have to get into a fistfight
with Angelo and Aries.

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:40.025
You're crazy.

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:42.026
But...

00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:44.863
Thank you.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.050
Wrong answer.

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:49.571
What you're supposed to say is,
"I love you."

00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:52.841
You're crazy.

00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:55.229
I love you, Jay.

00:03:57.413 --> 00:03:58.905
- To infinity—
- Keifer.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.449
Is there a problem?

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.891
Uhm…

00:04:05.972 --> 00:04:09.078
Can we change the ending
of your "I love you"?

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:11.584
That's too common.

00:04:14.908 --> 00:04:16.243
Alright, fine.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.060
I love you, Jay.

00:04:22.255 --> 00:04:24.848
Until scientists find
the end of the universe.

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.946
Is it because the universe is infinite?

00:04:30.222 --> 00:04:31.222
Exactly.

00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:40.164
Don't worry, Jay.

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:42.609
If Angelo finds out about us,

00:04:43.264 --> 00:04:44.264
I'll talk to him.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.921
Even if it ends in a fistfight.

00:04:52.494 --> 00:04:53.494
I love you, Jay.

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:57.714
Until scientists find
the end of the universe.

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:01.970
Mark Keifer Watson.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:04.456
I love...

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.111
Huh?

00:05:06.135 --> 00:05:07.135
Ci-N!!!

00:05:08.222 --> 00:05:09.723
You're such a nosy kid!

00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:11.141
Unbelievable, Jay.

00:05:11.508 --> 00:05:14.659
I know I'm handsome,

00:05:14.683 --> 00:05:17.039
but you don't have to tell Keifer
that I'm actually the one you like.

00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:19.132
- Huh, really?
- So it's "I love you, Ci-N" now, huh?

00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:21.116
- Give me the other one, I'll make it even!
- Jay!

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.066
My wound hurts!

00:05:23.916 --> 00:05:26.796
You're really going to pick a fight
with me even when I'm about to leave?

00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:28.664
You're leaving?

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:30.032
Yeah.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.791
Mommy said the condo is ready.
I can move in already.

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.272
You're leaving me?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.240
Well, you said you didn't want to
apply as my helper anyways.

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:39.749
Ouch!

00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:42.634
- Stop hurting me!
- You're already treating me like one here!

00:05:43.258 --> 00:05:45.052
- Stop.
- Hurting you, huh?

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.090
You know what,

00:05:48.408 --> 00:05:49.408
I'm going to miss you.

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:53.491
Visit me, okay?

00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:54.863
Of course.

00:05:55.553 --> 00:05:58.173
You should be serving me this time,
you treated me like a helper here.

00:05:58.197 --> 00:05:59.180
So dramatic.

00:05:59.204 --> 00:06:02.113
- Yes! You've been treating me like one ever since!
- Not even!

00:06:02.137 --> 00:06:03.124
That's not true!

00:06:03.148 --> 00:06:05.264
I've been so nice to you.
I clean your room.

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:08.614
I wash your clothes, prepare your food.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.746
This room is clean because of me.

00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:12.515
Do you want Yogorino?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.186
I'm happy for Ci-N.

00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:17.640
I hope he'll be happy in his new home.

00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:21.817
I also found a new home
with these assholes.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.046
But because of the complicated situation
between me, Keifer, and Yuri,

00:06:26.877 --> 00:06:28.518
everything feels like it's falling apart.

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:36.909
What's wrong, Jay?

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.510
You suddenly spaced out.

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:40.162
Huh?

00:06:41.164 --> 00:06:42.164
Nothing.

00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:43.523
Come on let's sleep.

00:06:57.077 --> 00:06:58.187
Jay-jay,

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:00.595
you should talk to Yuri.

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:02.856
If you're choosing Keifer,

00:07:03.213 --> 00:07:04.714
you need to tell Yuri immediately.

00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:08.845
Do whatever it takes to keep
this home from breaking apart.

00:08:44.832 --> 00:08:48.676
[Ci-N singing off-key]

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.677
Okay, that's enough.

00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.290
You're really getting on my nerves, Ci-N.

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:53.792
Just shut up, even for five seconds only!

00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:56.216
- Damn it!
- Wow, when you get all giddy, you get cranky huh?

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:58.019
Whatever.

00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:01.481
You're so noisy!

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:03.149
That hurt.

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:06.921
Wait, you go ahead. I
think I forgot my ID upstairs.

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:08.214
Wait for me outside.

00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:09.966
- Alright, hurry.
- Okay.

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.149
Shut up.

00:09:11.439 --> 00:09:12.439
Hey.

00:09:14.506 --> 00:09:15.506
What?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.266
You're getting married to Yuri.

00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:20.335
You're just too beautiful, aren't you?

00:09:21.738 --> 00:09:22.738
How stunning.

00:09:23.824 --> 00:09:26.232
You're marrying Yuri, and yet,
you also have Keifer.

00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:39.655
Aries is right even if he's annoying.

00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:42.485
I need to tell Yuri the truth.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.950
I don't want to play with
his feelings anymore.

00:09:46.638 --> 00:09:47.865
That was never my intention,

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:50.767
and I don't want to hurt him
more than I already have.

00:10:06.342 --> 00:10:08.469
How should I tell Yuri?

00:10:10.648 --> 00:10:12.808
Should I text him and say
I need to tell him something?

00:10:16.087 --> 00:10:19.786
Can't go to school. I have a fever.
Please take care of yourself.

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:30.139
Damn it, what great timing!

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.180
What's wrong?

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.386
Nothing.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:42.933
Where's Ci-N?

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.233
Oh, he went to Rakki.

00:10:48.254 --> 00:10:49.254
So,

00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:51.201
are you going to tell me?

00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:53.205
Tell you what?

00:10:53.962 --> 00:10:54.962
What's bothering you.

00:10:57.989 --> 00:10:58.989
It's because

00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:01.901
I've been thinking of telling Yuri about us.

00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:04.954
What do you mean?

00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:07.625
I feel guilty.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.920
I want to.

00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:11.945
I don't want to lie to Yuri anymore.

00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:15.551
I understand.

00:11:16.362 --> 00:11:18.155
Even I am feeling guilty.

00:11:19.073 --> 00:11:20.073
Like,

00:11:20.098 --> 00:11:23.351
Why did we even end up
liking the same girl again?

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.965
I was planning to go see him later.

00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:29.618
I'll tell him then.

00:11:30.096 --> 00:11:31.096
I'll take you there.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:32.985
No need to, I can handle it.

00:11:34.696 --> 00:11:36.529
I know you can, Jay.

00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:38.823
But like what I told you,

00:11:40.196 --> 00:11:41.196
I'm with you.

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:43.286
We'll face everyone.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.834
But I'll stay downstairs.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.214
We might end up beating
the crap out of each other.

00:11:57.542 --> 00:12:00.253
But if anything happens, call me.

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:02.122
I'll run upstairs right away.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.266
Thank you.

00:12:31.513 --> 00:12:32.513
Jay.

00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:45.765
I want you to be happy, Yuri.

00:12:46.783 --> 00:12:48.159
I'll only end up hurting you.

00:12:49.411 --> 00:12:51.663
I can't bear to see you get hurt anymore.

00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:54.148
I need to tell you the truth.

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:55.833
Right now.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.370
I'm.

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:17.143
I'm sorry, Yuri.

00:13:20.022 --> 00:13:22.190
Believe me, I really tried.

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:24.428
What's wrong, Jay?

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:25.903
What happened?

00:13:26.558 --> 00:13:27.558
But…

00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:29.024
What?

00:13:31.004 --> 00:13:32.338
It's really Keifer.

00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:47.901
I know.

00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:52.362
I knew from the start it was Keifer.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.560
Right?

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.643
Just like with Ella, Jay.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.710
I just tried.

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:06.909
But I lost again.

00:14:07.442 --> 00:14:08.442
Right?

00:14:14.674 --> 00:14:15.674
I'm not stupid.

00:14:16.873 --> 00:14:18.060
I know everything, Jay.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.589
Even what happened on New Year's Eve.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.446
Even if you didn't tell me, I knew!

00:14:25.549 --> 00:14:26.549
Yuri...

00:14:26.842 --> 00:14:27.842
Surprised?

00:14:28.521 --> 00:14:30.231
You thought only Keifer had eyes?

00:14:31.732 --> 00:14:32.732
Yuri...

00:14:36.111 --> 00:14:37.111
Leave, Jay.

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.575
I will let you continue
what you have with Keifer.

00:14:43.162 --> 00:14:44.705
But on our wedding day,

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:47.151
you will say "I do."

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:49.688
Because if you don't,

00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:53.809
I'll destroy Fer Corp.

00:14:54.787 --> 00:14:55.787
- Remember that.
- Yuri.

00:14:56.392 --> 00:14:57.977
Yuri, you'll only get hurt.

00:14:58.193 --> 00:14:59.611
You're already hurting me, Jay.

00:15:08.418 --> 00:15:09.418
Remember this Jay,

00:15:10.938 --> 00:15:11.938
in the end,

00:15:13.211 --> 00:15:14.212
you will be mine.

00:15:16.044 --> 00:15:18.230
- Yuri, stop it.
- Just leave.

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:21.087
Leave.

00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:24.903
You're just like Ella.

00:15:27.652 --> 00:15:28.652
You lead people on.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:55.845
Keifer…

00:15:58.213 --> 00:16:00.076
He doesn't want to call off the wedding.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.672
Just say the word,
I'll go up there and punch him.

00:16:05.523 --> 00:16:07.633
You said you didn't want trouble.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.970
Then stop crying.

00:16:11.283 --> 00:16:12.820
I hate seeing you cry.

00:16:25.998 --> 00:16:27.291
Your nose is runny.

00:16:28.162 --> 00:16:29.608
Fuck you.

00:16:32.473 --> 00:16:33.473
Jay,

00:16:35.674 --> 00:16:37.163
don't worry about the wedding.

00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:40.082
We still have enough time

00:16:40.304 --> 00:16:43.377
to figure out how to stop it, okay?

00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:51.719
Wipe your snot.

00:16:52.635 --> 00:16:55.513
- It's just a little.
- You're gross.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.481
Jay.

00:17:05.314 --> 00:17:06.315
What?

00:17:09.187 --> 00:17:10.313
I talked to Percy.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.392
Remember my promise

00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:16.818
about getting your father's information?

00:17:18.452 --> 00:17:19.452
Well,

00:17:19.878 --> 00:17:24.043
I got his contact and called him.

00:17:25.974 --> 00:17:28.268
But his secretary was
the one who answered.

00:17:35.606 --> 00:17:37.083
Hello, you've reached Mr. Mariano.

00:17:37.107 --> 00:17:38.400
May I know who's on the line?

00:17:38.776 --> 00:17:39.934
This is Keifer Watson.

00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:42.005
May I speak to Mr. Mariano?

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:43.029
This is urgent.

00:17:43.217 --> 00:17:44.277
Keifer.

00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:45.390
How are you?

00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:50.862
Oh crap, you're making me cry!

00:17:51.183 --> 00:17:52.183
Who's this?

00:17:52.208 --> 00:17:53.626
You forgot about me already?

00:17:54.353 --> 00:17:58.119
Has it really been that long that
you forgot about your dead friend?

00:17:59.733 --> 00:18:00.733
My heart!

00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:02.461
I'm in pain!

00:18:02.486 --> 00:18:03.486
Percy?

00:18:04.321 --> 00:18:05.321
Finally!

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.638
I thought you'd never remember
my handsome voice.

00:18:08.784 --> 00:18:10.261
I have no time for your shit.

00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:12.550
I need to speak with Mr. Mariano, now!

00:18:16.334 --> 00:18:18.169
Mark Keifer Watson,

00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:20.712
You haven't changed one bit.

00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:22.548
- Still so bossy.
- Percy!

00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:24.716
Still thinking you're the king?

00:18:25.968 --> 00:18:28.905
I'm talking about
Jay-jay's father, not you.

00:18:28.929 --> 00:18:31.640
Keifer, you're already
talking to Mr. Mariano.

00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:33.738
Well. I have to go.

00:18:34.601 --> 00:18:35.601
Don't worry,

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:37.479
we'll be back soon.

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:40.586
And when we do,
we'll take Jay-jay back from you.

00:18:43.841 --> 00:18:45.384
Take what back?

00:18:45.976 --> 00:18:47.978
I don't understand.

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:50.779
I'm also confused.

00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:54.434
I guess we just have to wait and see.

00:18:57.508 --> 00:18:59.760
I'm tired of waiting, Keifer.

00:19:04.237 --> 00:19:06.181
Just... please be patient, Jay.

00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:21.042
Shall we go?

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:22.419
Let's go.

00:19:41.745 --> 00:19:42.955
Hey, it's Angelo!

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:46.986
Hurry, lift it up!

00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.691
- Hurry, lift it up!
- Leave it up to me, I'll take care of Jay-jay.

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:57.154
Maybe in 2 weeks, we'll inform Jay-jay.

00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:04.477
You said you were going to fight him.

00:20:04.816 --> 00:20:05.984
Why are you hiding?

00:20:06.422 --> 00:20:08.582
Of course I need to prepare, he's strong!

00:20:09.127 --> 00:20:10.822
"Of course I need to prepare,
he's strong!"

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.623
And may I remind you
of our offices in Guam.

00:20:19.143 --> 00:20:22.521
I'll see you soon, bye.

00:20:27.723 --> 00:20:28.870
He's gone.

00:20:29.155 --> 00:20:31.032
You can stop hiding now.

00:20:33.124 --> 00:20:34.124
Let's go.

00:20:36.076 --> 00:20:37.076
Ouch!

00:20:38.181 --> 00:20:39.181
Hurry up.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.492
Oh, Aries.

00:20:48.723 --> 00:20:49.723
Come on, Jay-jay.

00:20:58.314 --> 00:20:59.314
I love you, Jay.

00:21:00.036 --> 00:21:02.261
Until scientists find
the end of the universe.

00:21:26.635 --> 00:21:27.821
- What even is this?
- So dramatic.

00:21:27.845 --> 00:21:28.863
Are you carrying your
entire house inside this?

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:29.887
It's so heavy!

00:21:31.128 --> 00:21:32.128
Ouch! Damn It!

00:21:33.198 --> 00:21:34.877
- Jay.
- What?

00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:41.425
I know I'm handsome, and you
might have fallen for me already...

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.054
But you didn't have to tell Keifer
that I'm the one you love.

00:21:45.468 --> 00:21:46.594
Fuck you!

00:21:46.695 --> 00:21:47.932
Jay!

00:21:48.155 --> 00:21:49.340
You're such an idiot!

00:21:49.364 --> 00:21:51.539
- So full of yourself!
- You're just jealous of my belly fat!

00:21:51.563 --> 00:21:53.708
I've got belly fat too, dumb-ass!

00:21:53.732 --> 00:21:55.584
Then why are you pinching
mine if you have one?

00:21:55.608 --> 00:21:57.524
"Then why are you pinching
mine if you have one?"

00:21:57.548 --> 00:22:00.694
- Whatever!
- Jealous much, Jay-jay?

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.890
Why are you even teasing me?
I'm already helping you carry this!

00:22:05.612 --> 00:22:08.132
You should've carried
this all on your own!

00:22:08.156 --> 00:22:09.300
What's in this anyways?

00:22:09.324 --> 00:22:12.678
This luggage is insanely heavy!

00:22:12.702 --> 00:22:13.702
Ouch!

00:22:16.153 --> 00:22:17.153
Ouch!

00:22:22.493 --> 00:22:23.493
Jay!

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:24.596
It's your fault!

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.221
Aries, I'm sorry!

00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:27.245
Aries!

00:22:27.826 --> 00:22:28.970
Are you okay?

00:22:28.994 --> 00:22:30.222
Sorry!

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:31.229
That hurts!

00:22:31.253 --> 00:22:32.939
What hurts?

00:22:32.963 --> 00:22:34.395
Where did that come from anyway?

00:22:34.602 --> 00:22:36.413
Sorry, that was mine.

00:22:36.437 --> 00:22:38.748
Even on your way out,
you're still a nuisance!

00:22:38.772 --> 00:22:40.834
It's my fault, I'm sorry.

00:22:40.858 --> 00:22:42.110
Don't yell at the kid.

00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:43.862
Sorry.

00:22:49.488 --> 00:22:51.386
You weren't being careful.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:52.746
You brought too much.

00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:56.481
Let's go?

00:22:56.766 --> 00:22:58.335
Dr. Peralta is waiting for you.

00:22:58.688 --> 00:23:00.498
- Alright.
- You're coming with us, right?

00:23:00.523 --> 00:23:01.523
Yes.

00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:03.334
Then why are you still dressed like that?

00:23:03.358 --> 00:23:04.358
Go change.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.150
I've got this.

00:23:09.156 --> 00:23:10.290
I'll just get the other two.

00:23:16.494 --> 00:23:17.627
Thank you,

00:23:18.144 --> 00:23:19.437
for driving Ci-N home.

00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:21.610
Thanks for the free food, too.

00:23:21.913 --> 00:23:22.913
You want some?

00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:26.656
Finally, I get to eat in peace.

00:23:27.003 --> 00:23:28.839
No spoiled brat trying to steal my food.

00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:31.971
Maybe finish chewing what's in
your mouth before you speak.

00:23:34.993 --> 00:23:38.194
Is there really no other
way to save the company?

00:23:39.113 --> 00:23:40.273
To save you?

00:23:41.657 --> 00:23:42.657
Jay-jay?

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:48.583
Don't be scared, I'm Tiger.

00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:50.497
And I own this place.

00:23:50.521 --> 00:23:51.805
Jay-jay, pizza.

00:23:53.215 --> 00:23:54.215
Tiger?

00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:56.491
I knew it was you!

00:24:00.722 --> 00:24:02.464
- Leo?
- Angelo?

00:24:02.488 --> 00:24:05.009
- Long time no see, bro!
- Leo, long time!

00:24:05.033 --> 00:24:06.118
How are you?

00:24:06.292 --> 00:24:08.544
I'm good, what are you doing here?

00:24:09.091 --> 00:24:12.405
Just met with someone,
paid off some things.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.537
Then bought a few stuff.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.205
You're really everywhere, huh?

00:24:17.374 --> 00:24:18.601
Anyways, it's nice seeing you here.

00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:19.792
Nice to see you.

00:24:24.746 --> 00:24:25.965
I'll poke your eyes out!

00:24:26.226 --> 00:24:28.246
You're so cute, you really love pizza.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.010
Can I have one? Just one.

00:24:31.065 --> 00:24:32.790
Wait.

00:24:33.275 --> 00:24:34.360
You know each other?

00:24:35.488 --> 00:24:39.242
Yeah, I met her when
they went to Kingsground.

00:24:40.827 --> 00:24:44.082
Fuck, Jay-jay! Play dead before
Angelo actually kills you.

00:24:44.107 --> 00:24:46.752
I'm just here, are you at the parking lot?

00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:48.362
Well, would you look at that. Alvin!

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080
How are you?

00:24:51.165 --> 00:24:52.149
Alvin!

00:24:52.173 --> 00:24:53.492
Oh, Angelo!

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:54.950
Hi Jay.

00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.015
Leo?

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:02.417
Hey, don't look at me like
I'm some horrible person.

00:25:03.837 --> 00:25:06.923
Sorry, you just look older.

00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:10.300
Well, how was it?

00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:16.075
We had a four-year gap
back in HVIS, right?

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:18.602
But you really do look older and uglier.

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:21.019
- Right?
- Uglier?!

00:25:21.292 --> 00:25:22.477
Are you crazy?

00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:23.895
Hey, hey!

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:26.233
He's our senior, show some respect.

00:25:27.144 --> 00:25:28.687
Respect, my ass.

00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:30.821
Angelo, am I really ugly?

00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:34.254
Of course not, just very ugly.

00:25:36.946 --> 00:25:39.871
Whatever, you guys are just insecure.

00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:43.417
Because I'm too handsome.

00:25:43.668 --> 00:25:44.925
Whatever, losers.

00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:46.878
Hello, are you there already?

00:25:47.978 --> 00:25:48.961
I'll see you guys.

00:25:48.985 --> 00:25:50.048
That was hilarious!

00:25:50.746 --> 00:25:52.561
You guys are funny.

00:25:55.189 --> 00:25:56.189
You.

00:25:57.608 --> 00:25:59.461
You went to Kingsground
without my permission?

00:25:59.485 --> 00:26:01.004
You're really stubborn, huh!

00:26:01.028 --> 00:26:02.894
- But that was a long time ago!
- Even so.

00:26:03.405 --> 00:26:04.896
You're such a stubborn little shit!

00:26:05.229 --> 00:26:06.303
You're in so much trouble.

00:26:11.705 --> 00:26:12.779
Hello, mom?

00:26:12.998 --> 00:26:14.100
We're about to go home.

00:26:14.124 --> 00:26:16.251
Huh?! What happened?

00:26:17.294 --> 00:26:18.452
Okay, we're on our way.

00:26:18.954 --> 00:26:20.163
What's the matter?

00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:23.123
Aries was rushed to the hospital.

00:26:23.234 --> 00:26:24.722
- Why? What happened?
- I don't know.

00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:35.381
A complication with his lungs?

00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:37.137
Since when?

00:26:38.287 --> 00:26:41.791
I didn't understand what Auntie Gema
and the doctor were talking about.

00:26:47.156 --> 00:26:48.156
Jay.

00:26:49.325 --> 00:26:50.325
What's wrong?

00:26:53.564 --> 00:26:55.071
You're thinking about it again?

00:26:57.888 --> 00:27:00.911
It's because of Aries, he's in the hospital.

00:27:01.088 --> 00:27:02.381
Why, what happened?

00:27:04.353 --> 00:27:07.273
He apparently has Pulmonary Fibrosis.

00:27:07.957 --> 00:27:09.132
I don't understand it either.

00:27:18.784 --> 00:27:20.389
Aries is going to be okay.

00:27:22.177 --> 00:27:23.262
He's Aries.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.985
Wow, so sweet.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.446
- What's funny?
- You're blushing again, Jay!

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.470
No, I'm not!

00:27:41.515 --> 00:27:43.245
Look at Jay-jay, she's blushing.

00:27:45.823 --> 00:27:48.576
- She's turning red.
- Another thing I'm worried about is Yuri.

00:27:49.931 --> 00:27:52.141
What if he goes back
to how he was before?

00:27:53.027 --> 00:27:57.342
What if he goes to see
Leo, a.k.a Tiger, again?

00:27:57.719 --> 00:27:59.011
I hope not.

00:27:59.992 --> 00:28:03.432
Okay everyone, fix your chairs.

00:28:04.948 --> 00:28:06.575
I said fix your chairs!

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:09.661
Bring out your books.

00:28:11.497 --> 00:28:13.248
Please be quiet.

00:28:14.291 --> 00:28:15.777
I said bring out your books.

00:28:18.128 --> 00:28:22.358
If the demand is less than the supply,
the price will go down.

00:28:22.382 --> 00:28:25.376
And if the supply is
greater than the demand,

00:28:25.934 --> 00:28:27.289
the price will go up.

00:28:41.026 --> 00:28:42.337
Ma'am!

00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:44.130
May I go out, please?

00:28:44.154 --> 00:28:46.016
No, you may not.

00:28:47.407 --> 00:28:48.407
Hey!

00:28:58.459 --> 00:28:59.686
Class!

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.757
Mr. Watson and Ms. Mariano,

00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:02.800
what's going on?

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.327
Actually, it's Mrs. Watson.

00:29:09.022 --> 00:29:10.749
“Mrs. Watson!”

00:29:11.124 --> 00:29:13.043
Ci-N, help me!

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.422
Behave, everyone!

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.480
Ms. Mariano, please take your seat.

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:26.407
And you Mr. Watson, if you're really
listening to this class.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:29.685
Can you please explain
the definition of profit?

00:29:30.951 --> 00:29:31.951
There, serves you right.

00:29:32.344 --> 00:29:33.344
Sure.

00:29:33.804 --> 00:29:36.765
Profit is the financial
gain a business makes.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.711
It is calculated by subtracting
total costs from total revenue.

00:29:43.104 --> 00:29:46.644
Wow!

00:29:48.139 --> 00:29:49.622
What's "profit" in Tagalog?

00:29:54.395 --> 00:29:56.045
“Profit," "Income."

00:29:56.872 --> 00:29:58.522
How about "expensive profit?"

00:30:02.445 --> 00:30:03.488
[in Tagalog] “I love you?”

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.716
Nice one, Keifer!

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.972
I love you, too.

00:30:09.285 --> 00:30:11.393
"I love you!"

00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:18.808
Class, settle down!

00:30:26.594 --> 00:30:28.095
Such a stunner!

00:30:40.608 --> 00:30:43.425
- I got here first.
- Fall in line properly!

00:30:47.073 --> 00:30:50.474
Wait, where are Drew,
Denzel, and Mayo?

00:30:50.785 --> 00:30:51.828
Did you see them?

00:30:52.703 --> 00:30:53.703
Jay!

00:30:56.374 --> 00:30:57.934
Jasper!

00:30:57.958 --> 00:30:59.293
Whatever!

00:30:59.401 --> 00:31:00.652
Jean.

00:31:01.361 --> 00:31:02.488
You jerk!

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.478
Mariano.

00:31:04.948 --> 00:31:06.073
Whatever!

00:31:07.618 --> 00:31:08.826
Watson.

00:31:11.205 --> 00:31:12.456
That's you, not me.

00:31:13.165 --> 00:31:15.769
Jasper Jean Mariano Watson.

00:31:15.793 --> 00:31:20.899
[Section E teasing]

00:31:20.923 --> 00:31:22.172
My wife.

00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:26.218
My life.

00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:28.656
All that sweetness is
rubbing on my cooking.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.680
Huh?

00:31:31.615 --> 00:31:32.615
My everything.

00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:35.019
What is he even talking about?

00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:39.286
Pay attention, Jay.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.525
The food is salty but there
are ants everywhere.

00:31:42.355 --> 00:31:44.524
My food's starting to taste sweet!

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.781
Whatever, assholes!

00:31:46.912 --> 00:31:48.497
Look at her, getting all giddy!

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.534
Can you please add some more?

00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:53.930
Hey, hey!

00:32:04.069 --> 00:32:07.551
Hey, three dumbos!

00:32:09.422 --> 00:32:10.738
So you guys are here.

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:12.073
No wonder you weren't downstairs.

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:13.432
- The food is good.
- Jay.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.100
Why?

00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:16.659
Are you and Keifer together now?

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.890
Seriously, are you two together?

00:32:23.436 --> 00:32:24.980
No.

00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:29.239
Ci-N just said earlier that there's
something between you two.

00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:31.087
Are you choosing Keifer?

00:32:31.815 --> 00:32:32.815
What about Yuri?

00:32:33.871 --> 00:32:35.289
You should've chosen him.

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.400
I can't teach my heart who to choose.

00:32:38.425 --> 00:32:39.402
Even so!

00:32:39.426 --> 00:32:41.052
You don't understand.

00:32:41.428 --> 00:32:42.822
What do you mean?

00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:44.505
Keifer will just hurt you.

00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:50.344
I just hope you won't regret
choosing him over Yuri.

00:32:53.857 --> 00:32:55.641
Section E is divided once again.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.394
I hope you don't get caught
in the middle of all this.

00:33:01.114 --> 00:33:02.114
Come on bro, let's go.

00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:20.624
Will this be the same as the big
mess they had with Ella before?

00:33:22.636 --> 00:33:23.887
What have I done?

00:33:24.888 --> 00:33:26.463
Will it happen again?

00:33:27.318 --> 00:33:29.800
Will the home we built fall apart?

00:33:30.644 --> 00:33:31.831
What should I do?

00:33:40.904 --> 00:33:42.896
My mind is a mess again.

00:33:46.493 --> 00:33:49.236
What if those assholes suddenly
start fighting each other again?

00:33:54.406 --> 00:33:55.409
Yes?

00:33:56.429 --> 00:33:59.557
Jay, get dressed.
We're going somewhere.

00:34:01.399 --> 00:34:02.399
Wear a dress.

00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:06.487
Okay.

00:34:08.994 --> 00:34:09.994
A dress?

00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:23.937
What are we doing here?

00:34:24.307 --> 00:34:25.307
Jay.

00:34:32.607 --> 00:34:34.609
We're having dinner with Yuri
and his parents.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.823
Hey, you're here.

00:34:40.782 --> 00:34:42.497
- Come.
- Sorry, we're late.

00:34:43.073 --> 00:34:44.830
That's okay, have a seat.

00:34:45.688 --> 00:34:46.688
Sit.

00:34:47.794 --> 00:34:48.794
Thanks.

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:53.337
So Angelo, how is Aries?

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.290
He's okay now.

00:34:55.506 --> 00:34:57.633
Actually, Aries has had
that illness for a long time.

00:34:58.009 --> 00:35:00.641
His body was just shocked,
so he had trouble breathing again.

00:35:01.596 --> 00:35:03.598
Aries has been sick?

00:35:04.223 --> 00:35:05.641
Why didn't I know about that?

00:35:06.012 --> 00:35:08.181
Well I see, that's good to hear.

00:35:08.478 --> 00:35:13.399
So anyway, why don't we talk
about the upcoming wedding?

00:35:14.067 --> 00:35:17.028
Oh my gosh, I'm going to war again.

00:35:17.612 --> 00:35:20.466
You know actually
we wanted it next year,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.634
but dad doesn't want.

00:35:22.658 --> 00:35:26.792
So we'll just wait for Jay-jay's birthday.

00:35:28.122 --> 00:35:29.775
My birthday?

00:35:30.068 --> 00:35:31.278
Are they kidding?

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.089
My birthday is just a few months away.

00:35:33.308 --> 00:35:34.308
- Jay-jay.
- Yes?

00:35:38.552 --> 00:35:41.013
So Jay-jay,

00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:44.391
when do you want to choose your gown?

00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:47.978
Anytime is fine with me.

00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:52.651
Fantastic, I'll go with you.

00:35:59.968 --> 00:36:01.137
Why are you like this?

00:36:02.076 --> 00:36:04.288
I'd understand if you were angry at me.

00:36:05.012 --> 00:36:06.298
But why are you acting this way?

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.683
What's going on in your mind, Yuri?

00:36:08.707 --> 00:36:12.854
We should also have Jay-jay
start learning Nihongo,

00:36:12.878 --> 00:36:16.207
so she won't have a hard time
when she goes to Japan.

00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:17.258
[in Japanese] Yes, yes.

00:36:18.667 --> 00:36:19.986
Go to Japan?

00:36:20.326 --> 00:36:21.619
What am I going to do there?

00:36:22.924 --> 00:36:23.924
Jay,

00:36:24.581 --> 00:36:25.581
are you okay?

00:36:31.933 --> 00:36:34.144
I'll just accompany Jay outside
to get some fresh air.

00:36:36.021 --> 00:36:37.021
Okay, son.

00:36:45.197 --> 00:36:46.197
What do you want?

00:36:49.936 --> 00:36:50.936
Jay,

00:36:51.228 --> 00:36:54.337
can you at least try not to show
them that you don't want to marry me.

00:36:56.096 --> 00:36:58.349
Why are you putting me through this?

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:01.595
I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve your love.

00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:09.060
So I didn't really lose to Keifer.

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:13.009
Your heart has always belonged to him.

00:37:14.176 --> 00:37:15.176
But in the end,

00:37:15.678 --> 00:37:17.276
I'll still be the one you'll marry.

00:37:17.805 --> 00:37:19.278
You're going to be mine.

00:37:24.562 --> 00:37:25.789
I'll head back inside,

00:37:25.813 --> 00:37:27.411
I'll just make up an excuse for you.

00:37:30.276 --> 00:37:33.960
Shit, do I really have to go back inside?

00:37:39.952 --> 00:37:42.246
This girl looks familiar.

00:37:43.622 --> 00:37:44.622
Who's that?

00:37:44.748 --> 00:37:45.737
My best friend.

00:37:45.761 --> 00:37:47.488
- Ah, Keigan's girlfriend.
- Yeah.

00:37:49.091 --> 00:37:52.469
Oh, she's Blaster's best friend!
[phone ringing]

00:37:53.064 --> 00:37:54.941
The one in Blaster's phone wallpaper.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.362
You're Jay-jay, right?

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.064
Yes, why? Is there a problem?

00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:06.417
I was wondering if I could
ask for a favor?

00:38:06.441 --> 00:38:07.441
Jay!

00:38:10.779 --> 00:38:12.155
I see you met my girlfriend.

00:38:13.156 --> 00:38:15.158
This is Elixera Federicos.

00:38:16.243 --> 00:38:17.661
What are you doing here?

00:38:18.256 --> 00:38:20.302
We're gonna celebrate
my girlfriend's birthday here.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.352
By the way, Keifer's inside already.

00:38:24.376 --> 00:38:25.970
- Let's go?
- Keifer's there?

00:38:25.971 --> 00:38:26.404
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:27.381
Yeah.

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.908
Yuri's mom saw him and
invited us to sit with them.

00:38:31.468 --> 00:38:33.386
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:38:37.207 --> 00:38:38.207
What was that about?

00:38:38.713 --> 00:38:41.966
Doesn't she want Keigan to know
that Blaster is calling her?

00:38:42.508 --> 00:38:43.551
But why?

00:38:44.177 --> 00:38:45.177
Whatever!

00:38:45.386 --> 00:38:47.239
Your life's already a mess Jay.

00:38:47.263 --> 00:38:49.074
Don't mess with other people's problems.

00:38:49.098 --> 00:38:50.433
Just stay quiet.

00:38:56.772 --> 00:38:58.000
I like your hair.

00:38:58.024 --> 00:38:59.251
I like your hair like that.

00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:00.693
- Like this?
- Yeah.

00:39:01.027 --> 00:39:02.880
Who is this witch?

00:39:02.904 --> 00:39:04.405
Where did she crawl out of?

00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:07.720
Is she related to Freya?

00:39:08.033 --> 00:39:09.702
Her face looks like a canvas, too.

00:39:11.406 --> 00:39:14.510
Elixera, I forgot, happy birthday!

00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:15.771
Happy birthday!

00:39:18.663 --> 00:39:22.417
Okay, let's eat! Come on, dig in!

00:39:24.252 --> 00:39:25.503
Please, go ahead.

00:39:27.171 --> 00:39:28.171
Dear,

00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:31.259
where did you meet Keifer?

00:39:32.093 --> 00:39:33.970
Oh, that's a great question.

00:39:35.054 --> 00:39:36.615
Would you like to tell them how?

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:38.659
Yeah, actually I met her at a party.

00:39:38.683 --> 00:39:41.296
Her name is Honey Bee Ryder.

00:39:43.021 --> 00:39:44.549
Damn you, King of Assholes!

00:39:44.814 --> 00:39:46.301
I've lost my appetite.

00:39:46.524 --> 00:39:48.261
Maki, open your mouth.

00:39:48.485 --> 00:39:49.485
Maki?!

00:39:52.322 --> 00:39:54.282
Yeah, why?

00:39:55.825 --> 00:39:57.062
That's Keifer's nickname,

00:39:57.618 --> 00:39:58.897
I gave it to him.

00:39:59.537 --> 00:40:01.108
Do you have a problem with that?

00:40:02.623 --> 00:40:05.445
Why aren't you doing anything?

00:40:05.585 --> 00:40:07.253
Are you not going to say anything?

00:40:07.503 --> 00:40:08.503
Nothing.

00:40:14.218 --> 00:40:15.720
Is that Mr. Billion?

00:40:15.887 --> 00:40:16.887
Yes.

00:40:18.139 --> 00:40:21.434
Angelo, come, we'll introduce you.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.255
Will you excuse us?

00:40:23.556 --> 00:40:24.641
Excuse us.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.810
- Why did you-
- That's your favorite, right?

00:40:40.546 --> 00:40:41.546
Thanks.

00:40:45.821 --> 00:40:46.822
So,

00:40:47.657 --> 00:40:49.297
what's your relationship with each other?

00:40:55.218 --> 00:40:56.302
Uhm…

00:41:00.807 --> 00:41:02.100
We're more than friends,

00:41:03.684 --> 00:41:04.811
but less than lovers.

00:41:09.816 --> 00:41:11.776
So like,

00:41:12.527 --> 00:41:14.764
there's no official label?

00:41:15.905 --> 00:41:17.966
Okay, I get it.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:19.033
I understand.

00:41:19.784 --> 00:41:23.514
Actually, there are people who
really don't want official relationships.

00:41:23.538 --> 00:41:24.538
Like

00:41:25.081 --> 00:41:26.416
like Maki,

00:41:27.417 --> 00:41:29.502
he doesn't want to be official with me yet.

00:41:54.193 --> 00:41:55.193
I love you.

00:41:56.779 --> 00:41:58.642
Do you think this will
make my heart flutter?

00:41:59.453 --> 00:42:00.453
Stupid-ass!

00:42:07.006 --> 00:42:08.072
Profanity.

00:42:10.782 --> 00:42:12.723
Wow, this asshole is really something.

00:42:14.802 --> 00:42:16.455
Profanity, my ass!

00:42:20.023 --> 00:42:21.023
Hey!

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.205
I want your full attention.

00:42:25.681 --> 00:42:26.681
Only mine.

00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:32.335
I like you hair like that.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:34.730
Jealous?

00:42:37.606 --> 00:42:39.227
I'm just annoyed with their faces.

00:42:40.538 --> 00:42:41.809
You are jealous.

00:42:42.422 --> 00:42:43.563
Do you want to get even?

00:42:45.172 --> 00:42:46.172
Giggle.

00:42:46.852 --> 00:42:47.852
What should I Google?

00:42:47.877 --> 00:42:49.150
Google, huh?

00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:51.235
Google?

00:42:53.875 --> 00:42:54.875
Giggle!

00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:57.200
- You said Google!
- Giggle.

00:42:57.775 --> 00:42:59.494
You're Jay-jay, right?

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:06.542
You look familiar to me.

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:08.970
Impossible,

00:43:08.994 --> 00:43:11.172
my beauty is unique. Quite hard to find.

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:14.384
Yeah, you really are hard to find.

00:43:15.042 --> 00:43:16.210
I don't see it.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.425
How about you?
Where do you find people like you?

00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:25.937
People like me are hard to find.

00:43:27.263 --> 00:43:28.389
Such a copycat.

00:43:28.722 --> 00:43:29.765
I'm one of a kind.

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.360
But I think your kind can be found at…

00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:34.022
At the zoo.

00:43:36.525 --> 00:43:37.568
What do you mean?

00:43:38.068 --> 00:43:39.445
You look like an animal.

00:43:39.736 --> 00:43:42.340
Oh my God, an animal?

00:43:42.364 --> 00:43:43.490
You're so funny.

00:43:46.076 --> 00:43:47.494
You're so ugly.

00:43:48.495 --> 00:43:49.794
I mean, funny.

00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:53.125
Did she just call me ugly?

00:43:54.992 --> 00:43:57.411
You know what, I don't like your tone.

00:43:58.221 --> 00:43:59.681
No, scratch that.

00:44:00.348 --> 00:44:01.850
I don't like you at all.

00:44:02.142 --> 00:44:04.453
It's okay, I don't like you too.

00:44:04.477 --> 00:44:05.871
- Oh, really?
- Do you want me to poke your eyes?

00:44:05.895 --> 00:44:06.956
Relax.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.729
- Really?
- Relax, please.

00:44:09.316 --> 00:44:11.067
Don't make a scene here.

00:44:17.324 --> 00:44:18.467
I'll just go to the restroom.

00:44:18.491 --> 00:44:19.618
So annoying.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:21.910
You wanna join me?

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.727
Go on, try standing up from that chair.

00:44:27.751 --> 00:44:29.270
That will be the last time you'll be able to.

00:44:29.294 --> 00:44:30.378
Go on!

00:44:45.692 --> 00:44:47.191
That bitch!

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:00.118
There's something between you and
the one you're with a while ago, right?

00:45:01.743 --> 00:45:03.033
And Keifer, too?

00:45:05.163 --> 00:45:06.495
So, you're a flirt.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.460
You know what?

00:45:13.713 --> 00:45:14.754
You're not…

00:45:17.245 --> 00:45:18.258
Even pretty.

00:45:19.969 --> 00:45:21.489
But with the way you flirt,

00:45:21.513 --> 00:45:23.679
it's as if you'll run out of boys!

00:45:31.564 --> 00:45:33.274
You got that from your mom, didn't you?

00:45:41.366 --> 00:45:42.575
Why can't you answer me?

00:45:44.536 --> 00:45:45.787
Am I right?

00:45:46.454 --> 00:45:47.454
You're just like your.

00:45:49.332 --> 00:45:51.000
Oh my God!

00:45:52.127 --> 00:45:53.545
Oh my God!

00:45:56.798 --> 00:45:58.359
There's blood!

00:45:58.383 --> 00:46:00.009
What the fuck?!

00:46:00.385 --> 00:46:01.594
You bitch!

00:46:03.221 --> 00:46:05.765
I'm nothing like my mom, no.

00:46:05.932 --> 00:46:08.641
I'm not like her.

00:46:09.352 --> 00:46:10.643
I'm nothing like my mom.

00:46:10.895 --> 00:46:12.436
I'm not like her.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.490
Jay.

00:46:15.325 --> 00:46:16.325
What's wrong?

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:17.890
Why do you care?

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:20.477
Are you jealous?

00:46:21.903 --> 00:46:22.903
No!

00:46:24.178 --> 00:46:25.161
You're jealous.

00:46:25.185 --> 00:46:26.168
I said I'm not!

00:46:26.192 --> 00:46:27.211
You're really jealous.

00:46:27.235 --> 00:46:29.529
For fuck's sake, can't you understand!

00:46:29.737 --> 00:46:31.507
And why would I be jealous,
you're not my boyfriend anyways!

00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:34.075
You might have even said "I love you"
to that Honey, you jerk!

00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:36.628
Profanity, you owe me so much.

00:46:37.945 --> 00:46:39.280
Get your kisses from Honey!

00:46:39.566 --> 00:46:41.086
And you say you're not jealous at all.

00:46:51.794 --> 00:46:53.254
Hey, what's up?

00:46:53.847 --> 00:46:55.056
Kit, time to pay up.

00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:58.094
- Hurry, pay up.
- Let's make a bet, if I make this shot.

00:47:00.763 --> 00:47:02.724
Hey Drew, pay up.

00:47:03.015 --> 00:47:04.058
Trying to run away, huh.

00:47:05.143 --> 00:47:06.829
- Pay for me first, bro.
- Screw you, man!

00:47:06.853 --> 00:47:08.653
- I'll pay you back tomorrow.
- I'm broke too!

00:47:08.771 --> 00:47:10.231
Rory, here's mine.

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:11.890
Where did you steal this from?

00:47:12.024 --> 00:47:13.024
Are you stupid?

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.443
- Where?
- Rory!

00:47:14.756 --> 00:47:15.775
Here's my payment, too.

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:16.967
Oh, you're already paid.

00:47:17.745 --> 00:47:19.330
Huh? I haven't paid yet.

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.027
- Huh?
- I haven't paid yet.

00:47:21.051 --> 00:47:22.386
Keifer paid for you.

00:47:24.823 --> 00:47:25.800
Hey, Eren!

00:47:25.824 --> 00:47:27.386
Why did you pay for me?

00:47:27.943 --> 00:47:29.138
Where's your payment?

00:47:31.155 --> 00:47:32.281
I want to.

00:47:34.032 --> 00:47:35.227
But that's my expense.

00:47:36.827 --> 00:47:38.021
What's wrong with it?

00:47:38.328 --> 00:47:40.120
I've treated you before, remember?

00:47:41.206 --> 00:47:42.206
Whatever,

You know Honey wants to sue you
because of what you did.

She deserves it.

00:48:06.473 --> 00:48:10.096
Good thing I convinced her not to.

You need to get the signature of
your previous school's counselor.

The records that they gave us
back then were incomplete.

We kept calling them,
but they always said,

It probably isn't much of a hassle for you.

Especially since your
retreat is next week.

It will be held near your old school.

I hope you can get this signed by then.

00:50:38.284 --> 00:50:40.680
I will just inform your adviser about it.
