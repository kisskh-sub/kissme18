[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.830
[Episode 15]

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.270
It's time to bring out

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.400
the extra dishes as well.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.090
Xiao Yao!

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.430
Xiao Yao!

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.370
Xiao Yao!

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.329
What should we do, Xiao Yao?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.520
Dali, hang in there!

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.600
Hong Ye once said that vengeful spirits

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200
favor the chill of yin
and fear the heat of yang.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.320
Dali,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.520
do you remember the Wind-Control Technique
Xiao Ming taught us?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.960
Yes.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.050
Follow my lead in a moment.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.870
Okay.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.490
Don't see me.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.350
Don't see me.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.360
Don't see me!

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.000
Now!

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.220
Wind-Control Technique!

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.460
Xiao Yao.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.940
Xiao Yao, are you okay?

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.470
I'm okay.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.190
Xiao Yao,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.040
why did you make such a big fire?

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.970
The candles are almost burned out.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.920
The vengeful spirits are gone.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.180
Does that mean we've cleared this level?

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.400
Why is it that
we still can't open the door?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.630
Exactly.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.390
According to what Pianpian said,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.650
we should have cleared this level by now.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.320
Why are there four exits?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.030
Dali,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.770
which one is the real exit?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.680
Exactly.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.940
Which way should we go?

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.720
Xiao Yao,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.450
what do you think we should do?

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.360
The candlelight's back to normal.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.410
Looks like all four doors will work.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.360
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.020
They should all be connected.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.780
Dali,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.660
which one are you going to take?

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.290
Follow her.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.580
Dali, wait for me!

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.110
And me, Dali!

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.040
Wait up!

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.570
I'll go check this side then.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.020
I'll take this one.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.960
Xiao Yao,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.560
let me wipe your face clean first.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.850
Thank you.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.810
They got lucky.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.040
The next level

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.840
will be the real challenge.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.360
What's the rush?

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.910
Don't you fear death?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.950
The mechanisms in this courtyard
are even more bizarre.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.350
You'd better observe carefully yourself.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.480
Little Leaf, give me a hint.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.070
Won't you use your brain at all?

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.920
Want me to flick your forehead?

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.430
Look at these stone statues.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.830
None of them have hearts.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.960
What do you mean by that?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.810
So you want me to draw hearts on them?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.070
One's appearance is a reflection
of their heart,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.710
and the heart spawns five ghosts:

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.480
jealousy,

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.909
vanity,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.640
greed,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.310
sloth,

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.450
and schadenfreude.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.780
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.160
Figure it out yourself.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.240
No more hints.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.090
Leaving things half-said—

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.560
what's your problem?

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.350
Why won't this candle light?

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.340
Xiao Yao.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.440
Thanks for saving us just now.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.240
If you need any help, just ask.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.200
Yeah.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.200
Xiao Yao.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.320
As expected, you're the best.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.380
You figured out the trick right away.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.440
I've always known
Xiao Yao was extraordinary.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.000
Look.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.600
We only made it through earlier
thanks to Xiao Yao.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.360
-Exactly.
-That's right.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.150
Dali.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.870
-What about us? What should we do?
-Xiao Yao, had I known you were this good,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.200
I would've stuck with you
from the very beginning.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.670
Exactly.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.790
Yeah. I wish I had followed you
from the start.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.360
Indeed.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.200
Alright, everyone, let's focus on
finding clues first.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.510
As long as we don't fight among ourselves,

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.720
I believe we'll be able to pass the trial.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.200
-Alright.
-Okay.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.510
Mm.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.040
Alright.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.440
A few compliments
and she's acting all high and mighty.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.910
If we followed all her instructions,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.510
we'd be sending her straight into
the Immortal Lord's favor for nothing.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.110
Just butter her up a bit
to her face, that's all.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.270
How come their clothes look so nice?

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.270
They don't know how to do anything,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.510
yet they've been pampered since childhood.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.370
And look at her—

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.120
there's actually jade on her shoes.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.480
One pair costs as much as

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.630
all the clothes my father and I

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.480
have ever worn combined.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.750
Xiao Yao.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.200
Ning'an.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.390
All Hong Ye ever thinks of is you.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.630
What's so special about you?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.510
Xiao Yao?

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.150
Xiao Yao, what's wrong with you?

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.790
Xiao Yao!

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.510
Xiao Yao, wake up!

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.730
What am I doing?

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.510
You...

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.360
Can you hear me now?

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.520
How did that happen?

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.200
I wasn't myself just now.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.390
Who said you could touch me?

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.390
How dare you touch me?

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.360
Why did you hit me?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.390
I meant to hit you!

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.600
-You started it!
-What are you doing?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.670
My father outranks yours,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.360
how dare you hit me!

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.600
Stop arguing, both of you!

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.550
What's wrong with practicing weapons?

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.600
Someone as fragile as you

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.870
would never be chosen
by the Immortal Lord!

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.510
I'm better than you at everything—
music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.000
The Immortal Lord will surely favor me.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.910
-Why did you push me?
-And you.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.000
I call you Dali every day
and consider you my sister,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.150
but look what you've done!

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.870
You're so useless!

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.440
Exactly!

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.720
Give me back my bracelet!

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.360
What are you doing?

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.150
Give it back to her!

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.790
Look,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.550
everyone has changed.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.960
Don't forget, I'm a general's daughter!

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.840
Who do you think you are?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.790
You dare push me?

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.440
You? You're not worthy!

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.690
I suddenly got really angry just now—

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.080
angry at them for having
nice clothes and possessions.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.440
No,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.890
it wasn't anger.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.110
It was jealousy.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.050
I was jealous of them just now.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.230
Why did I suddenly...

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.150
You think you're so tough, huh?

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.940
How dare you talk about my father
like that!

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.550
How dare you talk about my father
like that!

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.150
Give it to me!

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.080
Return it to her!

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.360
How dare you talk about my father
like that!

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.290
It's because of this stone statue.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.910
Give it back to her!

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.240
Give it back to me!

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.150
You didn't do anything!

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.390
What right do you have to take anything?

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.150
Exactly!

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.710
Give it back to me now!

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.790
Give it back!

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:17.520
My bracelet!

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.480
Who do you think you are to push me?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.540
You dare to resist?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.630
Are you crazy?

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.600
One's appearance is a reflection
of their heart,

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.460
and the heart spawns five ghosts:

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.610
jealousy,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.480
vanity,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.880
greed,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.350
sloth,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.350
and schadenfreude.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.000
Get lost!

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.570
I said get lost!

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.010
Stop fighting!

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.150
Let me go!

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.970
Let go!

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.030
Stop fighting!

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.750
Stop fighting!

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.440
Let go!

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.010
Stop fighting, all of you!

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.350
Stop fighting! Stop!

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.150
Put some effort into it!

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.900
Stop fighting!

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.670
Stop it!

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.920
It's none of your business!

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.870
What are you doing?

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.870
Give it back to me!

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.590
I'll kill you!

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.950
Give me back my bracelet!

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.200
-What?
-How could you say that about us?

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.750
Give it back to her!

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.320
Let go!

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.720
This is what you get for
talking about my father like that!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.450
Give it to me!

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.720
Stop fighting, you all!

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.910
Stop! Stop fighting!

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.910
Give it back to me!

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.960
Help!

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.980
Stop fighting!

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.790
This is her bracelet!

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.910
Why did you take it?

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.910
Hand it over!

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.370
First the cause, then the effect.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.990
It was jealousy, vanity, and greed

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.320
that turned us against each other.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.390
We can't let the stone statues
move anymore!

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:56.980
Let go!

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360
These five stone statues

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.980
are the cores of this formation.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.390
If the formation is completed,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.140
we might all die!

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.720
Go away! Don't touch me!

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.170
I need to get out of here alive.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.120
I still want to go out there
and enjoy wealth and glory.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.890
It's you!

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.840
We can't let the stone statues move!

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.960
What are you standing there for?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.840
Help me push!

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.140
Come help quickly!

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.410
Come on, hurry!

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.240
How impressive.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.890
She figured out the formation.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.420
Too bad,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.750
it's already too late.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.790
The stone statues are about to
return to their positions.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.960
They'll be trapped in their own desires

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.490
and never be able to escape.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.720
We and these stone statues
are bound by cause and effect,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.050
affecting one another.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.360
As long as we calm our minds,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.180
they won't be able to affect us!

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:08.840
What do you mean?

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.450
So you're saying

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.190
we should do nothing now?

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.360
Yes. Do nothing

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.080
and think of nothing.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.630
What kind of solution is that?

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.600
I think you're just trying to
get us killed as quickly as possible

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.910
so you can reap the benefits yourself!

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.670
That's right!

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.030
We all know what's going on.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.240
You were the one who led us
to find the key to the last level.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.900
Now that none of us can get out,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.550
wouldn't all the credit
belong to you alone?

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.630
I have absolutely no interest

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.840
in the rewards!

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.870
I only came here

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.530
for someone who matters to me.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.670
The Immortal Lord surely set up this trial

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.720
to select capable people

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.620
for her own use.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.670
You're all daughters
from official families.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.130
I'm sure you've heard that

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.270
only those who stay composed
in the face of Mount Tai collapsing

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.600
can achieve great things.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600
What does all this

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.720
have to do with us?

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.600
There's no other way now!

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.790
You have to trust me!

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.080
Close your eyes!

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:05.960
Remember,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.870
if you can't calm your minds,

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.330
think about happy things.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.000
Think about the people you love most.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.600
No matter what,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.330
just be happy and comfortable.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.720
They're gone. All gone.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.030
Great!

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.510
It's seven notes.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.250
We've got all the strings.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.310
Then can we get out of here now?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.350
♪ The moonlight lingers ♪

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.400
♪ My heart is heavy ♪

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:41.200
♪ Past memories shackle my spirit ♪

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.160
♪ Offer my flesh and blood ♪

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.510
♪ Comfort my soul ♪

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.240
♪ One person returns to the shadows,
while all others live ♪

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.830
"Offer my flesh and blood."

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.200
"Comfort my soul."

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.590
"One person returns to the shadows,
while all others live."

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.880
This means...

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.680
They'll select someone from among us
to offer as a sacrifice

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.010
to the vengeful spirits in the courtyard.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.110
♪ One person returns to the shadows,
while all others live ♪

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.040
This last level is the most ingenious.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.080
As long as a life is truly sacrificed,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.750
it will completely enrage
that vengeful spirit.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.490
Once she goes into a frenzy...

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.550
The one who draws the shortest stick

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.880
must accept the outcome and admit defeat.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.680
Go ahead and draw.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.480
I'll go first.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.310
Hurry.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.070
Dali,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.720
which one should I choose?

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.980
It's your own fate. Why are you asking me?

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.880
Go. Go over there.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.410
I won't draw.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:53.400
Xiao Yao,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.960
why do you always have to
make yourself stand out?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.560
I'm just following my heart.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.140
The candle is almost burnt out.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.160
Is what your heart wants

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.730
more important than
the lives of all of us?

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.960
Fine.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.570
I'll choose first.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.530
This one is yours then.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.000
Everyone, show your sticks.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.350
They're all the same length.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.720
Did you make the sticks wrong?

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.450
Who hasn't shown their stick?

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.440
Who is it? Who else?

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.550
Huang Ying! Huang Ying
hasn't shown her stick.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:34.750
Huang Ying, show it already.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.680
What are you afraid of, Huang Ying?

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.670
Her stick is the shortest!

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.640
Accept the outcome and admit defeat.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.400
That's right. Accept the outcome
and admit defeat.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:10.830
Exactly!

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.720
You can't!

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.240
The strings are all in tune.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.790
Sacrificing one person is now
a clear requirement.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.400
You've contributed the most,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.720
why keep interfering?

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.590
Huang Ying doesn't deserve to die.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.440
She's been trying to help everyone
all along

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.510
and has never harmed anyone.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.240
If she shouldn't die,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.570
should you die instead?

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.270
Or tell us,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.750
who should die?

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.000
She's so clumsy.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.570
Even if she gets out alive,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.720
she'll end up as fertilizer anyway.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.650
We might as well sacrifice her now!

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.040
That's right.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.310
Get out of the way,

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.030
or we won't be polite anymore.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.240
Who made these rules?

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.640
If the one who talks the most nonsense
should die,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.920
shouldn't it be you?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.640
If the one with the highest rank
should die,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.000
shouldn't it be you?

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.310
Can't you all use your brains?

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.830
From the moment we entered
the Courtyard of Mysteries,

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.830
every trial

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.920
seemed to require us
to compete for credit,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.720
but in reality,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.790
it was our united efforts
that helped us overcome these challenges.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.650
No one can decide another's fate—

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.840
not even Dreamshard Immortal.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.350
Xiao Yao.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.790
Dali.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.110
It's always the same ending.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.720
No need to watch.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.460
What are you doing?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.120
Dali.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.780
Don't go further down the wrong path.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.750
We can't waste any more time!

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.350
The candle is about to go out!

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.870
We need a life for the sacrifice,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.360
or we'll all die here!

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.960
Let's just pick up the sword

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.720
and kill her!

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.370
Let's go.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.020
Catch her!

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.920
Don't let her escape!

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.480
You can't go!

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.180
Kill her!

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.200
Kill her!

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.880
Kill her!

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.110
Stop right there!

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.370
Don't hold me back!

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.810
Let go!

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.790
She must die!

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.960
Let go!

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.690
If she doesn't die, we will!

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.700
Let go!

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:33.940
Huang Ying!

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.500
Kill her for me!

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.560
Let me go!

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:37.450
Huang Ying!

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.600
Let go!

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.640
Let me go!

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.520
Hold her down!

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.200
Don't move!

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.990
Let me go!

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.200
Come here!

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.380
Kill her!

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.110
Come here!

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.880
Kill her!

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.310
Let me go!

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.910
Let go!

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.910

How is this possible?

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.290
How could the sword break?

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.630
I didn't see them use any magic.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.000
Huang Ying,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.110
you...

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.830
Thank you, Xiao Yao.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.800
Actually, I am

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.690
the vengeful spirit
of the Courtyard of Mysteries.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.550
Many years ago,

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.770
I came to the Realm of Mist and Void
just like you.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.890
Since I wasn't as clever as others,

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.930
I was mocked

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.000
and ostracized.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.630
I originally thought that
as long as I treated others sincerely,

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.740
I would receive sincerity in return.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.300
But unexpectedly,

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.150
my constant forbearance

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.130
only led to daily

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.310
and increasingly severe bullying.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.000
Eventually,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.480
I committed suicide by hanging.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.690
The Immortal Lord didn't want my soul
to dissipate,

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.920
so he condensed my resentment.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.100
Every time newcomers arrive on the island,

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.680
he places me among them.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.550
First,

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.510
to test people's hearts.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.880
And second,

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.200
to give me a chance.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.650
If I meet someone who treats me sincerely,

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.000
my resentment can be soothed,

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.010
and I can reenter
the cycle of reincarnation.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.400
But every time,

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.290
I was despised
for being stupid and clumsy.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.480
Time after time, I got
isolated and rejected,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.370
repeatedly chosen as a sacrifice.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.930
They'd join forces and try to kill me
with that sword,

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.170
just like what you did.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.410
So each time, the ones who died

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.330
were actually those who tried to kill you.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.480
Testing human hearts again and again

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.440
has deepened my resentment.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.380
No one has ever escaped from
the Courtyard of Mysteries.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.440
Only tonight,

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.990
I met someone

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.790
who truly treated me as a friend.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.830
I also experienced

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.920
what it feels like to have someone

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.750
act selflessly for me.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.090
Xiao Yao.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.830
Now that the strings are all in place,

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.240
how about I play a song

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.520
for you?

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.720
Ling Yi

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.300
and Rou Jia,

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.740
go serve at the Spirit Garment Pavilion;

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.720
Yun Qi

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.200
and Ling Yun—

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.040
the Spirit Spring Pavilion;

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.110
Ren Shu—

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.700
the Biexin Courtyard.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.790
In today's trial,

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.350
one person stood out.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.210
Xiao Yao,

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.010
you will replace Ying Ning

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.860
as the personal attendant
to the Immortal Lord.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.790
I truly appreciate
the Immortal Lord's favor.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.350
But I only entered
the Realm of Mist and Void

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.590
to take Hong Ye away.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.640
I hope the Immortal Lord
will grant my wish.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.440
Xiao Yao,

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.880
the chance to serve the Immortal Lord
up close is extremely rare.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880
Don't be foolish.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.620
If there are other trials,

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.210
I'm willing to accept them.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.550
I just hope the Immortal Lord
will let Hong Ye and me leave.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:41.590
Alright then.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.640
I'll report your words truthfully

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.030
to the Immortal Lord.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.720
You may now go back to the flower sea
to water the flowers.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.200
Yes.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:51.790
Dali.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.480
I'm here.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.240
You are rewarded with the position

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.640
of personal attendant
to the Immortal Lord.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.240
I'll serve the Immortal Lord
with all my heart.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:23.180
[Lovely and intelligent]

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:25.480
Xiao Yao.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.720
[Lovely and intelligent]

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.250
Why did you turn down
such a good opportunity?

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:34.710
I only want to rescue Hong Ye
and return to Demons' Valley.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.200
At this point,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.830
do you still think you can leave?

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.300
You've witnessed what
the Dreamshard Immortal is capable of.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.560
We'll never be able to
get out of this Realm of Mist and Void.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.590
Why not try

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.450
to make life better for yourself?

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.890
Congratulations.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.370
Why do you always think you're right?

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.550
Hong Ye!

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.280
Hey!

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.190
Are you trying to drown me?

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.150
Little Leaf.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.840
Can you sense

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.670
how Hong Ye is doing now?

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.920
Is he well?

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.070
He's fine.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.980
Look, I'm even doing well here.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:01.760
How could anything happen to him?

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.190
Can you summon him here one more time?

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.300
I've realized

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.760
you either try to drown me

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.400
or want me to commit suicide.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.660
Who do you think I am?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.590
I'm just a primordial spirit.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.800
Every time I use my power,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.890
I have to use all my strength.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.050
You should know

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.440
the number of times I can use my power

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.760
is limited.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.320
Hong Ye only sent me here

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.400
to protect you.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.960
If I use my power recklessly,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.880
I'll soon wither like dry grass.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.850
Please don't cry, Xiao Yao.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.840
Take care of yourself first,

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.720
so you can be there
when the moment comes to meet him.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.800
Save your breath.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.110
Go ahead and do it.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.000
Are you really free of all attachments?

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.190
Is the wound on your face

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.510
healing well?

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.020
After I perish,

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.610
only my sister, Tan'er, will remain.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.670
If you could show mercy, Miss Pianpian,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.440
please spare her from
the torment of the Ghostly Fire.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:34.700
My power is limited.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.240
The Ghostly Fire

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.400
is formed from the vengeful spirits
of the unjustly dead,

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.600
and it fights endlessly with
the souls bound to the blade,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.290
never ceasing.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.760
Tan'er and you

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.360
share a similar fate.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.840
I truly hope that someday,

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.220
you both can leave
this Realm of Mist and Void

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.040
and live the life you want.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.070
How did my brother

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.480
really die?

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.710
He sacrificed his life for justice.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.960
He was a hero.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.920
I'm asking how he sacrificed himself
for justice

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.320
and who caused his death.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.300
Since he was a Feiyu Guard,

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.000
was he killed by demons?

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.860
My answer remains the same.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.670
If you truly want to know the truth,

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.320
help me find Tan'er.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.720
After we slay the demonic spirits,

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:05.480
I will tell you everything in detail.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.840
Why won't you give up?

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.030
As long as you can lure out
the Dreamshard's true form,

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.210
I can surely eliminate it.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.550
Only by leaving
this Realm of Mist and Void

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.660
will you understand what you truly want

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.590
deep down.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.840
Tan'er.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.840
Tan'er?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.240
Weren't you looking for my true form?

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.620
Here I am.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.490
I was confused for a moment

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.820
and have let you down, My Lord.
