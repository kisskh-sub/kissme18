WEBVTT

00:25.484 --> 00:27.193
Where should we go?

00:27.194 --> 00:30.113
Couldn't hear you.
What did you say?

00:30.114 --> 00:31.906
Well, where should we go?

00:31.907 --> 00:38.329
Hawaii is the obvious choice.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.749
Just think about it. Stop that.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.918
Will you stop and listen to me, please?

00:43.919 --> 00:46.671
There's a reason that people
convalesce at the beach.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.048
You'll complain about
sand getting everywhere.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.258
I'll be happy.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.053
Mmm.
Well, that's what's most important.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.936
Hurry the hell up, grandpa!

01:01.520 --> 01:05.482
The Rockies are cozy.
The cold isn't bitter there. It's warm.

01:05.483 --> 01:07.776
Cold is just cold, Joan.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.904
It's the kind of place
you could spend forever.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.198
It's 84 degrees in Naples today.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.325
Italy?

01:15.117 --> 01:18.036
- Florida.
- We're not Florida people, Larry.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.330
Oh, God. Joan, that sounds so snobby.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.499
We're not Florida people.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.084
You know,
you sound like Karen.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.962
Karen is my friend, and she is not well.

01:27.963 --> 01:31.884
Well, we don't have to make people
into saints ju-just because they're dying.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.011
Jesus, Larry.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.305
Look, it's got mountains and ice and snow.

01:37.306 --> 01:40.809
So many things for you to complain about.
You will love it.

01:40.810 --> 01:44.395
I don't love to complain.
That's not something people love.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.898
I don't want to fight. It's a big day.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.985
You know, people die at these things?
I saw it on the Internet.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.737
It's a gender reveal party.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.323
I mean, I get eliminating the surprise…

01:55.324 --> 01:58.409
- Can we just let them make a fuss?
- …but it's not party-worthy.

01:58.410 --> 02:02.622
You know, one of the great joys of my life
has been allowing for surprises.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.542
- Do you… Do you remember…
- Everything has to be a party nowadays.

02:05.543 --> 02:08.044
…when you were convinced
that Zach would be a girl?

02:08.045 --> 02:10.421
- Everything has to be an event.
- You just don't like parties.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.215
No. No, you just hate having fun.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.718
- Kids have preschool graduations now.
- You're only happy when you're miserable.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.720
You're five. You don't know anything.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.432
- Look, I… Can we just enjoy it? Okay?
- But, you know, you have the big party.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.643
- Big party.
- Larry!

02:23.644 --> 02:25.479
Can we just enjoy it, okay?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.147
Asshole!

02:28.148 --> 02:31.235
I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying it.
I'm enjoying it.

02:31.986 --> 02:35.030
Joan.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.284
- We have to tell them.
- I know.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.160
Just give me today.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.340
Sam, can you grab the balloons?

02:54.341 --> 02:55.800
Yeah, I heard you.
I'm getting the balloons.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.552
- We're back.
- Hey, Larry. How's it going?

02:57.553 --> 03:00.889
- Hi. You look lovely.
- We're back. Ah, the traffic, unbel…

03:00.890 --> 03:03.057
- Oh, hi. How are you, sweetheart?
- Oh. Thank you, Mom.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.642
- Hey. Hey.
- Grandma! Grandma!

03:04.643 --> 03:07.270
Good to see you, my dears.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.980
Let's go for some cake?

03:08.981 --> 03:12.233
- Sam, the balloons.
- I have the balloons in my hand!

03:14.361 --> 03:15.987
Thanks
for agreeing to host, Pop-pop.

03:15.988 --> 03:17.947
- This is gonna be a boy.
- How do you know that?

03:17.948 --> 03:21.659
Because it's so low. A boy.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.245
So, coming up on 65 years
of marriage. Any tips?

03:24.246 --> 03:26.581
You burst one of those balloons
and you'll never find out!

03:27.833 --> 03:29.792
Oh! Uh, Nana,

03:29.793 --> 03:32.420
we found a bunch of your old pictures
in the basement.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.589
Thanks, sweetie.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.340
Who is that?

03:35.341 --> 03:36.799
Pop-pop was in the army?

03:36.800 --> 03:40.887
No, sweetie. That was Nana's
stupidly attractive first husband.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.097
Jesus Christ, he's a dapper man.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.682
Why would you leave him for Pop-pop?

03:44.683 --> 03:46.434
No, sweetie.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.605
Luke was a soldier
and, um, he died at war.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.566
Lar, you got really lucky,
my friend.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.902
I bet he would have been a good dad.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.529
That's not how biology works.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.990
Lar?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.742
Hey, he's being funny.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.826
Shut up, Zach.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.328
- Larry, are you okay?
- Dad?

04:05.329 --> 04:07.205
- Dad?
- Larry! Larry!

04:08.582 --> 04:09.583
Larry!

04:30.479 --> 04:32.106
Guess you weren't expecting it?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.608
What the hell is going on? Where's Joan?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.403
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have now reached the junction.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.238
Please alight the train

04:40.239 --> 04:42.074
where your eternity lies ahead.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.742
I don't remember buying a train ticket.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.289
Well, I guess
the surgery didn't go so well.

05:13.897 --> 05:18.318
Mind your step.
Disorientation is normal.

05:22.364 --> 05:26.784
The newly dead from North America,
arriving in Junction 301.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.327
What is going on?

05:28.328 --> 05:32.290
Hey. All the fun of the Middle Ages
with none of the leprosy. Come on.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.834
Hey, you want to party?
Party all night, party for all time.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.711
Hey, pally. Good to see you.
You must be new.

05:36.712 --> 05:37.962
- Where am I?
- Jessica?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.589
He hasn't made contact yet.

05:39.590 --> 05:40.673
Jessica?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.884
- W-What is this?
- Your AC will be with you shortly.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.927
- Welcome, Sandro. Follow me.
- Hi. Can you help me? I--

05:44.928 --> 05:46.554
Your AC will be with you shortly.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.015
- Are you an AC?
- Yes, but I'm not your AC.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.600
- Come.
- Jessica?

06:00.736 --> 06:04.782
Final call for
the Dingle World, 174.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.287
Hi. Do you work here?

06:11.288 --> 06:13.998
No, honey. I'm here for my health.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.085
Listen.
I think I've been abducted.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.461
You haven't been abducted.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.589
Well, where's my family?
Where's Joan? Where am I?

06:21.590 --> 06:24.342
You're in the junction. Your AC will be--

06:24.343 --> 06:25.886
Be with me shortly. Yeah.

06:34.019 --> 06:37.356
Next arrival in 15 minutes.

06:44.655 --> 06:49.618
Final train from Junction 301,
departing in five minutes.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.954
Oh, Jill. This is all noise.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.038
I know you, Jill.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.249
You just want a box of Chardonnay
and a pool.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.959
I do like Chardonnay.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.086
Well, then I have the eternity for you.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.130
Okay.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.174
Yeah. Okay.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.135
Straight ahead.

07:08.554 --> 07:09.679
Oh. Sorry.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.143
You little bitch.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.729
Uh… Larry Cutler?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.898
Is there a Larry Cutler here?

07:20.899 --> 07:22.316
- That's me.
- Larry?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.735
- That's me.
- Oh! Hey, man. I'm so sorry.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.571
They had me at a whole 'nother gate.

07:26.572 --> 07:27.655
Who are you?

07:27.656 --> 07:29.198
I'm Anna. I'm your AC.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.910
- What does that stand for?
- Your afterlife coordinator.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.870
That's not a job.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.329
You've passed away, Larry.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.581
No.

07:36.582 --> 07:37.582
You're dead.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.252
No. I'm not. I-I hit my head. And…

07:41.587 --> 07:42.670
It's a girl.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.922
Walk with me.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.634
Oh. All right, listen.
So I was sitting with my family,

07:48.635 --> 07:50.136
- and then I, uh--
- Died.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.139
No, and I… Whatever you're trying to pro…

07:53.432 --> 07:54.807
It's not sore. Weird.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.851
Look, Larry.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.396
How is this happening?

08:00.022 --> 08:03.274
When you get here,
your form reverts to its happiest self.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.483
It could be any age.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.319
That's why there are lots
of 10-year-old boys,

08:06.320 --> 08:07.820
but not a lot of teenagers though.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.781
Ah, shit. Joan. Joan, my wife.
I need… I need to go back.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.367
Oh, Larry. Look on the bright side.
At least your penis works again.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.745
- Hey, Anna.
- My…

08:15.329 --> 08:16.996
My penis always worked.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.333
There's no need to feel shame here.
We've seen it all.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.626
Uh. Yeah. Well, if I was dead,

08:21.627 --> 08:24.587
I wouldn't really care
about the functionality of my…

08:24.588 --> 08:26.130
- Penis.
- Ugh.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.300
I wouldn't be embarrassed
and annoyed with you right now,

08:29.301 --> 08:32.346
because you're not supposed
to be annoyed in heaven.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.390
Oh, they tell you such strange things
down there.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.060
Larry, what is a soul?

08:39.770 --> 08:40.771
Uh…

08:41.563 --> 08:45.942
I don't know. I suppose
it's the perfect version of yourself.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.945
No. It's just you.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.697
No, that can't be right.

08:51.698 --> 08:55.076
If you were annoyed a lot in life, Larry,
then you might be annoyed a lot in death.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.661
Were you annoyed a lot in life, Larry?

08:56.662 --> 08:58.329
Listen to me. My wife really
needs me right now.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.789
I'm sorry. It doesn't work like that.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.709
Wake up, Larry. Wake up. Wake up.
Come on, buddy. Come on.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.002
What the hell is that?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.129
If you were dreaming,
you wouldn't feel that pain.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.589
I didn't feel that.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.217
You know, usually you old fellas really
cheer up about the whole penis thing.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.678
Listen to me, I need to talk to God, okay?
That's what I want.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.305
- I want to speak with the big guy.
- Okay, so you're one of those.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.182
I don't know why you didn't say that
in the first place.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.475
We got tons of eternities.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.144
What are you, New Testament,
Old Testament? Hindu, Buddhist?

09:22.145 --> 09:24.105
- Pick your poison.
- Hold on. Is God not real?

09:24.106 --> 09:25.273
I don't know. But, listen,

09:25.274 --> 09:27.400
after a couple hundred years
in one of these eternities,

09:27.401 --> 09:28.944
you won't even know the difference.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.529
Who do you work for?

09:31.530 --> 09:32.697
I work for Frank.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.490
Okay, then, uh, who does Frank work for?

09:34.491 --> 09:37.451
Frank works for Tom.
Why-Why does it even matter? Come on.

09:37.452 --> 09:40.454
We don't have time.
I got other clients, Larry, please.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.542
Okay. Well,

09:44.459 --> 09:48.421
I'm sorry for assuming that paradise
would look a little less like life.

09:48.422 --> 09:49.588
This isn't paradise.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.550
This is just a brief transition
between life and eternity.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.928
Oh, you've earned a life
worth an eternity.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.847
- I have?
- It's just something we say.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.473
Everybody gets an eternity.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.934
The good, the bad and the ugly.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.395
So all that "live a good life" stuff's
a-a bunch of crap?

10:04.396 --> 10:05.479
Afraid so.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.732
Red door escapee.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.233
- Get away from me!
- Do not engage.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.110
- Oh, that? Don't worry about that.
- Get away!

10:11.111 --> 10:13.238
Just don't run through any red doors.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.615
I can't go back. I can't do it anymore.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.076
Come here. Come…

10:19.077 --> 10:21.121
- Get off me.
- Larry, let's go. Let's go.

10:23.332 --> 10:27.419
Final call for Alpine World, 234.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.129
So this is where I'm staying, huh?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.673
For now, until you choose
the right eternity for you.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.092
But we'll get into all that later.

10:34.718 --> 10:39.806
- I think now's a good time. I'm dead.
- Hey. There you go. Acceptance.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.100
We have some of your favorite clothes
in the closet,

10:43.101 --> 10:44.770
in case you want to check it out.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.112
Anna?

11:18.303 --> 11:21.972
Didn't 1840s Ireland have a devastating
famine caused by a potato blight

11:21.973 --> 11:24.059
and the British exporting
all their other food?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.562
Well, not here.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.940
Ever wanted to be the captain of--

11:30.941 --> 11:34.485
Do you hate clothes,
but you need them to keep warm?

11:34.486 --> 11:41.159
Well, here in Natural State 454,
it's always a balmy 72 degrees.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.413
Ooh. Looking good, Jim.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.872
He's "cardiac-ing" really hard.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.083
Suction, goddamn it.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.296
- We lost him.
- But you found me.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.675
If you suffered a violent death,

11:57.676 --> 12:00.220
please reach out
to our afterlife counselors.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.973
You know,
I did, uh, experiment in college.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.539
Hi, there.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.249
Hi.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.710
Confusing time, huh?

12:32.711 --> 12:35.297
Yes, actually.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.926
Oh. S-Sorry, I'm… I'm married.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.388
What if I, uh, told you

12:44.389 --> 12:47.183
I could secure you a spot
in the hottest eternity…

12:47.184 --> 12:50.729
Marge. You know the policy.
No selling in the bar.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.483
No selling in the bar.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.656
Something strong, please.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.867
First day?

13:05.327 --> 13:07.203
So what are you,
like an angel or something?

13:07.204 --> 13:08.205
Oh, no, no.

13:09.331 --> 13:10.415
I'm a bartender.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.418
Oh, shit. Do I have to get a job?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.587
Only if you want to stay here.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.883
So what are you thinking about,
for where you want to go from here?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.553
Oh.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.972
I don't… I don't know.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.850
Somewhere sunny with a beach, I guess.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.230
But my wife won't like that,
so I can't stay for long.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.066
Did your AC go over the rules?

13:36.650 --> 13:38.609
No, but, uh, she seemed busy.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.277
All right. Well, look, the big thing

13:40.278 --> 13:42.655
is there's no switching eternities
after you've chosen.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.824
No visiting other eternities, no nothing.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.117
Eternity is eternity.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.410
It's forever.

13:48.411 --> 13:52.248
What if I didn't go along with the rules?
What are they gonna do, kill me again?

13:52.249 --> 13:54.124
Technically they can't kill you again.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.209
But you break a rule,

13:55.210 --> 13:58.547
you overstay your welcome,
or you try switching eternities,

13:59.339 --> 14:00.799
they'll put you into the void.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.675
Is that like hell?

14:02.676 --> 14:03.843
As close as there is.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.722
It's just blackness, for eternity.

14:09.933 --> 14:10.934
Um…

14:12.811 --> 14:15.855
My wife has cancer. It's terminal.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.482
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:18.483 --> 14:22.028
Worst part about death is the guilt
you feel for the ones you left behind.

14:23.405 --> 14:26.156
I know, and I told her that I was
always gonna take care of her.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.326
And now she's sick,
and dealing with all this.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.537
Um… Could I get a mixer with that?

14:31.538 --> 14:32.998
That is absolutely disgusting.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.669
Morning, sleepyhead.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.129
Morning, sweetie.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.261
What the hell?

14:47.053 --> 14:48.637
What's going on? How did you get in here?

14:48.638 --> 14:50.682
- Larry, you don't remember?
- Remember what?

14:51.850 --> 14:53.643
No, we didn't. Did we?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.936
Nah, I'm just joking. I have a key.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.730
- Why do you have a key?
- It's not important.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.483
So, you seemed to have
a good time last night.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.652
I'm dead. You wouldn't think hangovers
would be a thing.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.031
I know, right?
It's a common misconception.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.158
I got a question.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.743
Mm-hmm. Hit me with it.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.042
So, everyone working here, they don't want
to go to their eternity. Why?

15:17.751 --> 15:20.003
Some people haven't accepted death,

15:20.670 --> 15:23.672
and some people are waiting
for their loved ones.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.757
Oh.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.887
And others haven't decided yet,
and those are the worst ones.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.639
Well, why did you stay?

15:31.640 --> 15:34.975
That is a story
for another time.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.853
- Mmm.
- So, tell me.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.481
Where you going? Did you decide?

15:42.359 --> 15:45.277
No. I… I need to see where Joan is.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.905
- Mmm.
- How can I tell how close she is?

15:47.906 --> 15:50.699
No, I'm sorry. It doesn't work like that.
I can't do that.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.827
So all that looking down from above stuff,
that's just a bunch of BS?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.537
Mmm. You're annoyed?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.164
- No, I'm not annoyed.
- You look annoyed.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.375
What about everybody who died before me?
Where's my parents?

15:59.376 --> 16:00.626
How do I see them?

16:00.627 --> 16:04.421
You could definitely go see your parents.
But then, you know, you'd be…

16:04.422 --> 16:06.800
- Be with my parents for eternity.
- Eternity.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.762
That's why we usually recommend
for you to do you.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.390
And just know that everyone
is existing pretty damn good.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.558
You know what I mean?

16:19.688 --> 16:22.231
You know, Joan always thought of death

16:22.232 --> 16:25.025
as one more surprise
waiting around the corner.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.860
- Mmm.
- And she loved surprises.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.487
But she was a librarian though, right?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.239
Yeah, they can like surprises too.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.241
Oh.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.785
So if I wanted to wait,
what do I have to do?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.370
Get a job? Be a bartender?

16:36.371 --> 16:39.373
No. You wish.
It's cleaning work.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.584
- Do you know how to do laundry?
- Yeah.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.171
At least the room is nice.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.216
Yeah. But it's for clients.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.177
So if you don't decide,
then you have to go…

16:52.178 --> 16:53.595
Well, I was told there is no hell.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.098
- The basement.
- Oh.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.225
The rooms are more functional
in the basement.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.437
- Mmm.
- Jesus, you went straight to hell.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.648
You look like you hate people.
Try Hermit World.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.776
Hi. Excuse me…

17:07.777 --> 17:09.863
Do you want a little sniffle? And you?

17:17.036 --> 17:20.874
Final call for Cowboy World 167.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.131
Smoke, sir?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.051
It could be tomorrow.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.388
Or she could hang on for another,
what, six or seven months?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.974
I mean, I guess I could
set everything up for her.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.102
And I could, you know, make sure
it's… it's how she likes it,

17:42.103 --> 17:43.855
really make it feel like a home.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.274
Larry, that is so romantic.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.527
- I guess it is a little romantic.
- It's so romantic.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.071
- I can be romantic.
- I…

17:53.072 --> 17:55.658
- 'Cause I know how she likes things.
- You do.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.206
Oh.

18:44.207 --> 18:47.292
I really think you picked a good one.
You are not going to regret this, Larry.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.129
- Hey, hey, uh, would you do me a favor?
- Yeah, sure can do.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.256
Could you give Joan this letter for me?

18:52.257 --> 18:54.132
No can do. That's against the rules.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.134
Plus, why do you need a letter
when you got me?

18:56.135 --> 18:59.847
Beach Land 239,
now boarding at gate 12.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.598
It was a pleasure working with you.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.600
Yeah.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.022
Bye.

19:09.399 --> 19:10.608
Bye.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.863
Sorry. Oh.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.073
Ow.

19:19.909 --> 19:20.910
Shoot.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.412
Okay.

19:30.587 --> 19:34.549
Mind your step.
Disorientation is normal.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.890
Joan.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.100
Joan!

19:44.851 --> 19:46.351
Joan! Joan!

19:46.352 --> 19:48.562
That's my wife.

19:48.563 --> 19:49.898
Yeah. Come on, buddy.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.859
- It's that way.
- Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.280
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Come on.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.032
There you go.

20:00.033 --> 20:04.746
The newly dead from
North America, arriving in Junction 301.

20:07.081 --> 20:10.167
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry, where am I?

20:10.168 --> 20:12.377
Um, your AC will explain everything.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.088
Okay. Okay.
You know, it's just…

20:15.089 --> 20:18.009
Honey, your AC will explain everything.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.390
That looks nice.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.601
Joan. Joan! Joan.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.977
- Larry!
- Joan.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.230
- Sweetie. Ah, sweetie.
- Oh, my God.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.440
I missed you so much.

20:33.441 --> 20:37.194
- Hi. Oh. Oh, my God.
- Wow, look at you. Wow. I love this.

20:37.195 --> 20:41.281
I was, uh, I was in bed, and then I…
I thought I just came from a…

20:41.282 --> 20:42.699
- Baby, you look amazing.
- …a-a train.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.952
- Oh! Every time!
- Ow! Ow!

20:44.953 --> 20:48.747
God, every damn time, Larry.
I told you to slow down on the pretzels.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.791
- But, you… No, no, you never listen.
- I know, I know.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.167
Oh, you stop smiling.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.251
- Jo?
- Yeah.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.128
Listen to me, honey. I have shocking news.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.130
- You're dead.
- I'm dead.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.090
Yeah. How'd you know?

20:58.091 --> 20:59.174
I mean…

20:59.175 --> 21:01.635
It took him forever to figure that out.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.345
- Not forever.
- Yeah, forever.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.515
- No.
- So you are the famous Joan.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.476
Okay, Larry. Way to marry up.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.479
- Yeah.
- So, uh, what-what now?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.563
Yeah, so now, so--

21:13.564 --> 21:14.774
Was it cancer?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.819
That took you away from the world?

21:18.528 --> 21:19.778
So, who are you?

21:19.779 --> 21:23.031
Okay, honey. So listen,
now we finally get to have that holiday.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.450
And basically we can go
anywhere we want, but then that's it.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.036
It's like a one and done thing here.
They're very strict on that.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.997
Um, and if you want to go
to the mountains we can,

21:29.998 --> 21:33.375
because the snow and the cold's not
gonna kill you now, 'cause you're dead.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.293
- Back away from my client.
- I'm not near your client.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.545
- Back away.
- Shut up.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.755
I've been waiting for this golden goose
for 67 goddamn years.

21:38.756 --> 21:39.840
- Oh, Lar?
- Hi.

21:39.841 --> 21:42.092
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry about her.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.176
Who's that?

21:43.177 --> 21:45.554
I'm Ryan.
I'm your afterlife coordinator.

21:45.555 --> 21:46.638
Yeah.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.807
I know this can be
very, very overwhelming.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.809
It's a lot to absorb,
so I highly recommend just…

21:50.810 --> 21:55.230
…taking a deep breath in,
and… [exhales deeply] …out.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.191
Just breathe out.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.726
Oh. Hey. What's going on, guy?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.478
This was my, uh, bartender.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.689
I, um, guess I forgot to pay the tab.
I didn't realize there would be a tab.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.941
Nobody gave me any money.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.861
No way.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.780
Sorry. I forgot to ask your name.
What's your name again?

22:44.781 --> 22:46.281
I'm Luke.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.825
This is Luke. He's my bartender.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.453
Joan.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.330
Oh, no.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.542
I never dreamt you this clearly.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.003
You're exactly how I dreamt you.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.048
Oof. Hard luck, Larry.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.842
No. Luke had a mustache.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.552
Yeah, well, Joanie hated it.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.514
So I shave it off every morning
hoping she's gonna show up.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.392
- Oh, my God.
- How romantic.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.313
And you did.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.108
Okay, sweetie.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.818
- Okay.
- Oh.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.319
- What you doing?
- Larry?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.821
- Okay, sweetie.
- I…

23:25.822 --> 23:27.030
- Let's go.
- Oh.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.615
- Who's this guy?
- The second husband.

23:28.616 --> 23:31.368
- I prefer current husband.
- The current husband.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.330
- Oh.
- Joanie, you're all right?

23:34.997 --> 23:36.081
Oh, my God.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.792
Honey. It was a lot for me too.

23:38.793 --> 23:42.587
Okay. I have to insist that I explain
exactly what's going on to my client.

23:42.588 --> 23:48.301
She clearly has
a very "difficult" decision to make.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.887
- Okay. Oh, that…
- Come on.

23:50.888 --> 23:53.933
- Oh, my God, he's really here.
- And very attractive.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.017
Is he taller?

23:56.018 --> 23:58.020
So when you said you were waiting…

23:58.604 --> 24:01.107
I conjured her image every day in my mind.

24:02.066 --> 24:06.821
Thought I did a good job,
but she's more stunning than I remember.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.991
Okay. That's a line, Luke.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.326
You were my bartender.

24:14.662 --> 24:15.745
Hmm?

24:15.746 --> 24:19.167
Nope. Nope. Nope.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.420
- Uh, mmm no.
- God, he looked so young.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.796
This will have to do.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.757
Was he always that young?

24:27.300 --> 24:28.717
That's a lot to take in.

24:28.718 --> 24:32.179
The love of your life waiting 67 years.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.555
And Larry.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.223
Larry is my husband.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.225
- One of two.
- Yeah.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.310
Oh, that's pretty.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.646
You'll feel much better after you change
out of that morbid ensemble.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.858
Ah. Oh. Oh.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.318
Yeah, that's pretty.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.279
That's… Oh, he's so young.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.364
Oh, he's so young. Oh, I don't…

24:51.365 --> 24:52.908
What's your ETA, doll?

24:52.909 --> 24:55.703
- Oh.
- How's it looking?

24:57.747 --> 24:59.456
So… What…

24:59.457 --> 25:01.083
What am I supposed to do, huh?

25:01.584 --> 25:04.336
I need you to tell me…
…what to do.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.881
Oh, my dear. Okay. I read your file.

25:07.465 --> 25:10.300
And you are smart,
passionate and decisive.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.761
Oh. I am?

25:12.428 --> 25:16.056
I have complete faith that you
will choose the right eternity…

25:16.057 --> 25:19.142
- Yeah.
- …and the right person to spend it with.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.769
- Mmm.
- You'll do.

25:20.770 --> 25:23.105
Do for what?

25:24.315 --> 25:25.815
Were you expecting someone, or…

25:25.816 --> 25:27.109
Were you?

25:28.027 --> 25:30.528
Uh…

25:30.529 --> 25:33.991
Oh, my God, Luke.
What a surprise.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.201
What the hell, Reese?

25:36.202 --> 25:39.162
It's Ryan,
and it's been Ryan for the last half hour.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.957
- Yeah.
- You look amazing.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.084
Yeah. I'm married.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.961
- To him.
- To Larry.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.879
And Larry seems nice.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.092
Look, Joan, you must have thought,
or hoped, that this might happen?

25:52.093 --> 25:56.471
Well, I mean, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You know, I-I have imagined it.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.890
Great.

25:58.599 --> 26:00.016
Hi.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.185
- I'll leave you kids to it.
- Oh.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.271
Hi.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.482
Did you even read my file?

26:07.483 --> 26:10.068
You're more than words on a page
to me, buddy. You didn't even bring it up.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.195
Yeah, well, I had a lot on my mind.
I just died.

26:12.196 --> 26:16.241
So, I'm sorry that I forgot to mention
that my wife's ex might be hanging around.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.076
Technically,
I don't think we can call him her ex.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.703
First husband, maybe, but not an ex.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.788
No, I'm not calling…
I'm never calling him that.

26:21.789 --> 26:25.041
Okay. I'm just trying to anticipate
what Ryan's gonna say. We have history.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.334
Great. What kind of history?

26:26.335 --> 26:29.087
- It was sexual.
- Of course it was.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.173
You know how many people wanted this case?
So many people.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.258
Really?

26:33.259 --> 26:36.011
A man that's waited half a century
for his love? Ah!

26:36.012 --> 26:37.470
That's kinda sad if you think about it.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.473
You really think that's the way
that Joan's gonna think about it?

26:40.141 --> 26:41.975
- I don't know.
- It's okay.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.768
I'm sure they've had one of these before.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.687
I mean, I don't know about it.
I've never had it.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.023
But I bet you there's a process.

26:48.024 --> 26:50.318
- He looks like Montgomery Clift.
- Oof!

26:50.860 --> 26:53.278
Oh, my gosh,
I was saying this just the other day.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.239
Montgomery Clift. He is so handsome.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.700
- Luke is so handsome.
- You're not helping.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.703
I'm sorry, but it is what it is.

27:01.704 --> 27:02.996
Luke is hot.

27:02.997 --> 27:06.207
His eyes are bluer than the ocean.
He has a better narrative.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.459
No, he doesn't.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.835
I have a better narrative.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.755
I was married to her for 65 years
and I gave her children.

27:11.756 --> 27:14.591
Exactly. We go with that. That's strong.

27:14.592 --> 27:16.801
There's nothing more powerful
than emotional blackmail.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.094
- Right?
- Good on ya.

27:21.182 --> 27:24.101
So… …how have you been?

27:25.227 --> 27:26.854
Good. Yeah.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.359
Well, I mean, I've been obviously dead,
but, you know, good.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.861
- Well, you look good.
- Yeah.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.821
I mean, you know, you always…
you always looked…

27:36.822 --> 27:40.158
- You always looked good.
- Oh, yeah. Coming from you, huh?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.119
Oh. Oh.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.333
Oh.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.128
Yeah, I, uh…

27:54.090 --> 27:57.801
Look. I-I don't know what to say.
It's…

27:57.802 --> 28:00.178
Well, I had a long time
to think about what I was going to say.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.473
- Oh.
- I mean, I had a long, long time.

28:02.973 --> 28:03.933
And?

28:04.725 --> 28:06.685
And I'm drawing a blank.

28:07.228 --> 28:08.520
Oh.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.480
Warning. Code seven four.

28:10.481 --> 28:11.940
- Code seven four.
- Oh! Oh.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.525
- Eyes on the bogey.
- What the hell?

28:13.526 --> 28:15.151
Gary.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.195
Hey, Luke. You working tonight?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.780
Not tonight. Tonight's a night off.

28:18.781 --> 28:21.075
Wait. Is this…

28:21.659 --> 28:22.909
Mm-hmm.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.871
Joan? No!

28:26.831 --> 28:29.040
- No. No, please.
- Move it!

28:29.041 --> 28:31.418
I can't look at
another goddamn painting.

28:31.419 --> 28:32.794
- It's so boring.
- All right.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.212
- Well, I better go.
- No!

28:34.213 --> 28:36.214
- But, hey, you are one lucky lady.
- Hmm?

28:36.215 --> 28:37.298
Gary!

28:37.299 --> 28:38.466
- Oh.
- Huh.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.468
- Move it. I'm sick of this crap.
- No, please!

28:40.469 --> 28:41.970
Get in here now!

28:41.971 --> 28:43.138
Oof.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.681
Museum World's the worst!

28:44.682 --> 28:46.142
Oh, God.

28:47.268 --> 28:50.562
Oh, my God.
What-What did he do?

28:50.563 --> 28:52.565
Oh, he tried to escape his eternity.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.651
Once you've chosen,
you can't go back here.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.361
You have to get it right.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.780
- Oh, that's a lot of pressure.
- Yeah, it is.

29:00.781 --> 29:03.909
Look. I remembered
what I wanted to say to you first.

29:04.535 --> 29:05.536
What?

29:06.704 --> 29:07.746
I love you.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.125
Oh.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.461
That's a… That's a good opener.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.463
Yeah.

29:16.172 --> 29:19.717
Look, I know this is hard for you,
but I missed you.

29:21.177 --> 29:22.970
I thought about you every single day.

29:23.471 --> 29:26.724
There wasn't a day that went by
that I didn't think of you.

29:28.309 --> 29:31.145
Yeah. You know, I…

29:31.729 --> 29:33.230
I wanted you to be happy.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.608
I wanted you to have a life.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.777
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.446
But I waited.

29:41.447 --> 29:46.451
You know, I-I waited because I wanted us
to have a chance to have one too.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.204
Oh.

29:49.705 --> 29:50.788
I'm gonna be sick.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.624
- You okay?
- Oh, God. Why can you get sick here?

29:52.625 --> 29:54.709
- Joan.
- Oh.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.503
- You all right?
- Uh, Luke? Luke, please.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.879
I need to think.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.049
Okay?

30:11.644 --> 30:12.645
Oh.

30:13.437 --> 30:14.438
Okay.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.283
Luke?

30:27.159 --> 30:28.160
Oh.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.830
Okay.

30:38.212 --> 30:39.504
- Hey, sweetie.
- Oh, Larry.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.799
So, I know this is a lot, but don't worry.
I've been doing the research.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.801
And here are some pretty good options.

30:44.802 --> 30:45.927
Sorry, options for?

30:45.928 --> 30:47.179
Yeah, for our eternity.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.222
What?

30:49.223 --> 30:52.058
Wow. You really look amazing.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.185
- The long hair suits you. I love it.
- Oh.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.478
What?

30:55.479 --> 30:57.523
Oh. Everything works here.

30:58.107 --> 30:59.649
Oh, Larry.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.151
- What do you mean, "Larry"?
- Well, it's complicated.

31:02.152 --> 31:03.403
We were together a week ago.

31:03.404 --> 31:07.240
Yeah, well, a lot has happened in a week.
You died, Karen died. I died.

31:07.241 --> 31:10.618
I just been reunited
with both of my dead husbands.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.663
And I learned that I have only a week
to pick where to spend eternity.

31:13.664 --> 31:16.541
Karen finally kicked it.
It's a big week for Oakdale.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.543
Oh.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.669
Oh.

31:19.670 --> 31:20.671
Hey.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.382
- I know what'll make you feel better.
- Oh, what?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.508
Squatting.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.051
Oh, Jesus Christ.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.345
Just try it.

31:29.471 --> 31:30.972
- Fine. Okay.
- I'm telling you.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.140
- Come on. Go.
- Okay, fine.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.226
Go.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.021
Yeah.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.106
- Wow.
- I know, right?

31:39.690 --> 31:42.191
- I got so low there.
- You did get so low there.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.569
Yeah. I know. It feels so good.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.363
I've been doing a bunch of stuff.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.324
- Oh. Looking good.
- Yeah.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.868
- You look good.
- I know. Thanks. Thanks.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.037
- Work it out.
- I miss these hips.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.913
- Whoo!
- Oh, God.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.958
Yeah, look at this. Look at this.

31:59.918 --> 32:04.589
Oh. You were right.
That, uh, that did make me feel better.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.757
I knew it would.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.842
Oh.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.430
Are you kidding me?

32:12.431 --> 32:14.182
- Larry!
- It's too much salt.

32:15.476 --> 32:16.852
I need… I need time.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.104
Okay? I…

32:20.314 --> 32:22.190
I just… I need to clear my head.

32:22.191 --> 32:25.277
Okay. You're right. I'm being insensitive.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.072
And we can talk about it in the morning.

32:28.572 --> 32:29.990
- Thank you.
- Okay.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.420
- These are so stupid.
- Are you kidding me?

32:44.421 --> 32:45.755
What are you doing?

32:45.756 --> 32:47.006
I'm going to bed.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.342
I'm tired too.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.177
Long day for me.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.314
Oh.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.194
Oh, Larry.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.198
Oh.

33:17.329 --> 33:21.833
Remember,
geopolitical differences no longer matter.

33:21.834 --> 33:22.876
You are dead.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.714
Sorry, buddy, but your seven days are up.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.141
Holy crap.

33:38.142 --> 33:41.811
"Holy crap. For God's sakes. Bloody hell."
Are you sure you're not religious?

33:41.812 --> 33:42.979
Hey, hey, hey. Is he here?

33:42.980 --> 33:45.440
Oh, yeah, he is. But it's sad actually.

33:45.441 --> 33:47.609
No, he's… He-He's my Jo's favorite.

33:48.277 --> 33:49.902
- Him?
- Yeah. She loves him.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.155
- Really?
- He's the best.

33:51.822 --> 33:52.947
Oh, okay.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.073
Hey, do you know him?

33:54.074 --> 33:55.491
Yeah, of course I know him.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.909
Would he do you a favor?

33:56.910 --> 33:59.746
Who you talking to?
It's me. Obviously, duh.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.456
- But you're sure? Him?
- Yes.

34:01.457 --> 34:02.499
Okay.

34:03.083 --> 34:06.003
Wow. Look at this.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.839
Single bed. That's nice, right?

34:09.339 --> 34:12.216
We got ourselves here a kitchenette.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.426
Handy.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.178
Let's see what's in that fridge.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.305
Oh, my gosh.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.056
You are in luck.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.141
Hummus.

34:20.142 --> 34:21.435
You know what? It's fine.

34:21.935 --> 34:24.604
You sort this out for me,
I'll be outta here in no time.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.189
- Oh, I love it.
- This is gonna save it.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.607
I love it. You are focused.

34:27.608 --> 34:29.692
- Keeping your eyes on the prize.
- What's that smell?

34:29.693 --> 34:31.695
- It's hummus.
- No, it's not.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.297
I…

35:02.893 --> 35:03.976
All right.

35:03.977 --> 35:09.941
Ever think 1930s Germany would've
been great if it wasn't for all the Nazis?

35:11.193 --> 35:12.569
Well, think no more.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.160
Oh.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.037
Please be coffee.

35:23.372 --> 35:25.457
Okay. Please be coffee.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.000
Oh, Larry.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.627
I know, I know,
but I got a surprise for you.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.797
No, no, no.
I actually need less surprises.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.174
Like, just, you know, zero surprises.

35:35.175 --> 35:37.301
Joan, I promise you're gonna like this.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.303
You trust me, right?

35:39.555 --> 35:40.806
Yeah. Okay.

35:41.890 --> 35:42.891
Yeah.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.143
She trusts me.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.981
Next arrival in 15 minutes.

35:49.982 --> 35:51.816
You look incredible.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.359
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.403
Are you excited?

35:55.279 --> 35:57.698
- Sure.
- Got any ideas what it could be?

35:58.198 --> 35:59.366
No.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.951
- Here we go. Yeah.
- Oh, that's sweet. Look at you.

36:01.952 --> 36:02.953
That's for you.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.330
Need a little bubbles.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.373
Oh. That's, um…

36:07.374 --> 36:08.499
Yeah, that's sweet.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.084
What? Oh, no. That's not it.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.168
Oh, gosh.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.379
Lights!

36:16.300 --> 36:18.009
Look.
Look. Look up there.

37:16.276 --> 37:18.569
Anna, who the hell is this?
That's not Dean Martin.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.280
- Hey, baby.
- Of course not. It's Richard Johnson.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.116
- Oh, no. No.
- Celebrity impersonators die too, Larry.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.243
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
- I thought you knew.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.746
I thought it was weird you kept saying,
"This is Joanie's favorite."

37:28.747 --> 37:31.165
I was like, "Richard?
Richard is Joanie's favorite?"

37:31.166 --> 37:32.583
You knew that's not what I meant.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.878
Well, now that I say it out loud,
I understand that it does not make sense.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.214
- Please. I'm so lonely, babe.
- Oh.

37:38.215 --> 37:42.259
Also, he has a crippling alcohol problem,
and I forgot to mention that to you,

37:42.260 --> 37:43.719
and that's my bad.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.138
- That is your bad.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

37:46.139 --> 37:49.725
I can't fathom a scenario
which this could've gone worse.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.144
Help Ol' Blue Eyes
with his old blue balls, huh?

37:52.145 --> 37:53.730
- No, no, no.
- Oh, my…

37:54.398 --> 37:55.648
Oh. Hey, Luke.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.361
- Blue Eyes was Frank.
- You're the man, Luke!

37:59.945 --> 38:03.114
- It just got worse. It just got worse.
- Oh.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.782
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.826
- Yeah?
- Yeah, thanks. Sorry.

38:06.827 --> 38:08.244
I'm grateful that you were passing.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.787
Well, actually, I was… Um…

38:09.788 --> 38:11.747
- You were… No. Oh, no.
- Well, I was here because…

38:11.748 --> 38:13.332
Luke, take her back to the room
for a hot bath.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.583
Okay, yeah. I think we got it--

38:16.461 --> 38:18.796
I don't know what that guy was doing.
And why are you going--

38:18.797 --> 38:20.381
- What is wrong with you?
- I know. I'm trying.

38:20.382 --> 38:22.091
I thought it was the real Dean Martin.
I swear to God.

38:22.092 --> 38:24.344
- What's your problem?
- Stop! Stop it!

38:28.807 --> 38:29.933
You two, come with me.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.518
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.688
You two st… You stay here.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.315
Excuse me, y'all. Excuse me.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.192
Excuse me.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.278
You're excused.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.989
You know, I could've handled that myself.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.033
Yeah.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.160
Yeah.

38:49.202 --> 38:51.746
Yeah. Yeah.

38:51.747 --> 38:55.875
You know, my grandfather,
he had psychotic issues.

38:55.876 --> 39:00.547
And maybe it just skips a generation.
Because there's no way that this is real.

39:01.423 --> 39:05.802
How in God's name can this be real?
My God.

39:07.471 --> 39:08.472
Is this hell?

39:09.639 --> 39:11.016
Is this hell?

39:11.600 --> 39:13.769
- Technically, hell does--
- No, no! I didn't say speak.

39:17.481 --> 39:20.066
You ever work this place out?

39:20.067 --> 39:23.527
Nah. It just gets more and more confusing.

39:23.528 --> 39:27.490
Do not be alarmed.
Everything is as it should be.

39:27.491 --> 39:29.241
Gimme your phone. Just give it to me.

39:29.242 --> 39:32.870
Hey, honey. So we're talking
about bending the rules just a smidge.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.164
- It was my idea.
- It was my idea.

39:35.165 --> 39:39.043
I took his idea
and I made it better. I'm making a plan.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.503
Oh, it's about control?

39:40.504 --> 39:41.922
Yep. Yep.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.061
Oh.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.531
- So?
- Good news.

40:08.532 --> 40:11.158
- I talked to Frank, and basically--
- Actually, I talked to Frank.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.952
The point is, somebody talked to Frank.

40:12.953 --> 40:16.705
They then talked to Tom,
and then they talked to a guy way up top.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.375
- The big guy.
- Kevin.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.543
And you got approved for a plan.

40:20.544 --> 40:21.794
Anna, just say the plan.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.671
- Okay, sorry. So typic--
- So, typically here--

40:23.672 --> 40:24.881
Anna. You're Anna?

40:25.465 --> 40:26.633
- No.
- Okay.

40:27.175 --> 40:28.467
So typically when you get here,

40:28.468 --> 40:30.761
you get to pick eternity,
and that's it. Bing, bang, boom.

40:30.762 --> 40:35.766
However, in this unique circumstance,
you've gotten approved for a special visa.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.144
Joan will be allowed
two visits to an eternity.

40:38.145 --> 40:40.271
- One with each of her former husbands.
- Mm-hmm.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.524
- And then?
- And then she'll decide.

40:43.692 --> 40:44.859
Between the two of you.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.111
It seems like kind
of a high-pressure scenario.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.446
Okay. Well, you could all
choose the same eternity

40:49.447 --> 40:50.614
and then work it out from there.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.825
But then you'd be
in the same place together forever.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.118
Oh, that could work.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.411
- No, no.
- I'm done…

40:55.412 --> 40:57.163
I'm done with this guy creeping
in the shadows.

40:57.164 --> 40:58.831
- Creeping in the shadows?
- Lurking.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.708
- Lurking?
- Yeah. You're a lurker, pal.

41:00.709 --> 41:03.502
And you're waiting beyond to spoil
a half a century of marriage.

41:03.503 --> 41:05.254
Well, I'm sorry
I died defending our country.

41:05.255 --> 41:07.673
- It was Korea, buddy. Relax.
- What'd you say to me?

41:07.674 --> 41:09.885
You didn't exactly storm the beaches
of Normandy, did you?

41:11.469 --> 41:13.512
- What… What are you doing?
- You went there.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.014
Hey. Hey! Stop!

41:15.015 --> 41:16.140
- Hit him back, Larry.
- Stop!

41:16.141 --> 41:17.933
- I will bare-knuckle you.
- Yes, Luke!

41:17.934 --> 41:19.185
Stop it! Okay?

41:19.186 --> 41:20.937
This is what we're doing!

41:21.521 --> 41:23.773
So, just…

41:25.692 --> 41:28.068
flip a coin and decide who's going first.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.278
No.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.198
I will not stand for another man
dating my wife.

41:33.116 --> 41:35.868
Maybe you should've thought about that
before you married another man's wife.

41:35.869 --> 41:36.870
Boys!

41:37.954 --> 41:39.206
Who's going first?

41:41.666 --> 41:43.210
I have a coin.

41:50.258 --> 41:51.508
Oh, shit.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.928
- Is that a pretzel?
- No.

41:53.929 --> 41:55.554
- Oh, my God.
- You still eating pretzels.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.390
- Yeah. Relax.
- Get on with it.

41:58.475 --> 41:59.476
Heads or tails?

42:00.060 --> 42:01.061
Heads.

42:02.062 --> 42:05.564
The next stop
is Mountain World 312.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.566
Oh.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.197
- What?
- I just…

42:13.740 --> 42:15.408
forgot how handsome you are.

42:15.909 --> 42:18.202
We were an attractive couple.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.413
Oh, come on. Everybody…

42:20.997 --> 42:24.709
Everybody assumed that
you got me pregnant and had to marry me.

42:25.252 --> 42:27.419
Yeah, no. My mother, she was…
she was so upset

42:27.420 --> 42:30.089
when I told her that I wasn't,
because she…

42:30.090 --> 42:32.634
Well, she wanted hot grandkids so badly.

42:33.260 --> 42:34.343
Not that my kids are ugly.

42:34.344 --> 42:36.054
I'm sure that they are hot.

42:37.514 --> 42:39.014
Not that I care.

42:39.015 --> 42:40.099
I didn't assume.

42:40.100 --> 42:42.559
Yeah. 'Cause I'm not…
I'm not into hot kids.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.521
No, I'm not into hot kids either.

42:46.523 --> 42:47.732
Yeah.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.195
I'm not into kids.

42:53.488 --> 42:54.489
Good.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.157
That's good.

43:17.304 --> 43:19.347
I remember the sky being bluer.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.182
Oh.

43:21.891 --> 43:23.101
Was it always that shade?

43:23.643 --> 43:24.769
Oh, yeah. Pretty much.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.063
Is that cloud moving?

43:30.358 --> 43:31.359
Yep.

43:33.403 --> 43:34.404
They move.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.166
Is it how you imagined it?

43:46.833 --> 43:47.917
It's perfect.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.050
Oh, boy. Oh. Okay.

43:56.092 --> 43:57.426
Okay.

44:00.305 --> 44:01.306
Can't die twice.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.265
You can't die twice.

44:03.266 --> 44:04.350
Okay.

44:12.692 --> 44:13.693
This okay?

44:15.570 --> 44:16.613
Mm-hmm.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.281
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

44:20.325 --> 44:23.285
No, we didn't know
where to put any of the trash.

44:23.286 --> 44:26.623
And so we didn't know they had a place
where bears didn't get to.

44:27.207 --> 44:29.459
It's cold. Was it always this cold?

44:30.794 --> 44:32.962
It's cold.

44:35.215 --> 44:37.467
Let's get you
somewhere nice and warm, huh?

44:38.093 --> 44:39.176
Mmm.

44:39.177 --> 44:42.221
I don't like how Luke's been going around
telling people he died in the war.

44:42.222 --> 44:43.847
Larry, the man died in the war.

44:43.848 --> 44:47.893
No, I know, but it's the way he says it.
"The war," like it's one of the cool ones.

44:47.894 --> 44:51.271
Okay, I think we should stop squabbling
about his obvious heroism,

44:51.272 --> 44:53.732
because I don't think
that's our strongest point of attack.

44:55.026 --> 44:58.112
The problem is
Luke's always been a memory.

44:58.113 --> 45:00.073
Now, I don't know
how you compete with a memory.

45:00.782 --> 45:03.575
All we are, are a collection of memories.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.619
That's depressing. I don't like that.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.955
But the point is, you're going
to have to remind her

45:07.956 --> 45:10.083
of why she fell in love with you
in the first place.

45:11.543 --> 45:12.544
Honestly…

45:14.254 --> 45:16.713
I don't know why she fell in love with me.

45:16.714 --> 45:17.715
Mmm.

45:18.508 --> 45:22.178
Well, you're gonna have
to figure that out. And fast.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.809
There's someone here I gotta find.

45:28.810 --> 45:31.855
Okay. Now we're cooking.
Now we're cooking.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.568
My great-granddaughter Charlotte
would love this place.

45:37.569 --> 45:39.237
She's a little adventurer.

45:40.029 --> 45:42.157
I guess so was her mother,
for that matter.

45:44.784 --> 45:46.703
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

45:48.246 --> 45:49.789
I'm sure she misses you.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.167
So is that okay? You know, talking about…

45:53.168 --> 45:56.462
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

45:56.463 --> 45:58.338
- You're not angry with me?
- For what?

45:58.339 --> 46:00.966
It's just… Sixty-seven years, you know?

46:00.967 --> 46:06.096
I remarried after two years,
and you waited 67 years.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.891
Sixty-seven years. Wow.

46:10.143 --> 46:11.603
Mmm.

46:14.230 --> 46:15.273
Yeah.

46:21.488 --> 46:28.328
When eternity's on the line, one lifetime
of waiting seems like nothing.

46:30.205 --> 46:32.247
Jesus, you are so perfect.

46:32.248 --> 46:33.332
I'm not perfect.

46:33.333 --> 46:35.459
Oh, that's what perfect people say.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.461
Fine. I hate hearing about your kids

46:37.462 --> 46:39.463
and your grandkids
and the kids they had, okay?

46:39.464 --> 46:41.715
I mean, I don't-I don't hate them.

46:41.716 --> 46:42.717
Okay.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.764
But it kills me that I didn't get
to have all that with you.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.145
I'm glad you had it.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.441
I'm glad you had a happy life.

47:05.573 --> 47:08.159
I would go to the docks
waiting for you to return.

47:08.701 --> 47:11.286
Watching all the soldiers stream
onto shore,

47:11.287 --> 47:13.413
'cause I convinced myself
that they got it wrong.

47:13.414 --> 47:15.416
- That you would be among them. And…
- Joan.

47:18.336 --> 47:23.174
I would just sit and watch and wait.

47:27.595 --> 47:28.596
So I…

47:31.099 --> 47:32.850
I did wait for you, Luke.

47:36.271 --> 47:38.439
Yeah.

47:43.695 --> 47:44.778
Hmm.

47:44.779 --> 47:45.780
Hey.

47:47.907 --> 47:48.908
Come with me.

48:06.676 --> 48:10.346
If I wasn't already dead,
I'd be worried you're about to kill me.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.686
- Do you trust me?
- Oh. Sure.

48:17.729 --> 48:18.730
Come on.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.569
Hello, Mr. Fenwick.

48:25.570 --> 48:26.863
Just Fenwick.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.574
Right. Uh, we haven't been here before--

48:30.575 --> 48:32.535
Individual or shared?

48:34.621 --> 48:36.955
- Shared.
- Do not touch the exhibits.

48:36.956 --> 48:38.832
Remember, the exhibits aren't real.

48:38.833 --> 48:42.210
We take no responsibility
for emotional trauma.

48:42.211 --> 48:43.212
Happy reliving.

48:44.547 --> 48:45.631
You ready?

48:45.632 --> 48:46.633
For what?

49:00.271 --> 49:01.897
Every eternity has one.

49:01.898 --> 49:03.857
We call it archive tunnels.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.400
Which means?

49:05.401 --> 49:08.071
I don't know.
I've never been to an eternity before.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.784
We can find out together.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.004
- Hi. What's your name?
- Oh.

49:26.589 --> 49:27.882
- Yeah, you.
- Oh. I-I'm Joan.

49:28.758 --> 49:30.008
Yeah.

49:30.009 --> 49:31.510
What's your name?

49:31.511 --> 49:33.888
- Luke.
- Nice to meet you, Luke.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.807
- Oh, Luke.
- Joan's a pretty name.

49:36.808 --> 49:38.141
I haven't seen you around here before.

49:38.142 --> 49:41.144
Oh… …well,
I just moved to the city.

49:41.145 --> 49:43.146
Just around the corner. Briar…

49:43.147 --> 49:44.231
Briar cliff?

49:44.232 --> 49:45.233
Come on.

49:54.701 --> 49:57.370
- I was so nervous. Look at me.
- That's not what I'm saying--

49:57.954 --> 49:59.538
Look at you.

49:59.539 --> 50:01.791
Oh.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.674
Joan, I love you so much.

50:22.186 --> 50:23.187
Come on.

50:29.402 --> 50:31.236
Oh, nope. No, no.

50:31.237 --> 50:32.529
No. Luke, come on.

50:32.530 --> 50:35.741
- Oh, we're really going for it, eh?
- Hey.

50:35.742 --> 50:38.494
Stop!

50:57.221 --> 50:58.806
I don't wanna see this one.

51:03.686 --> 51:05.938
I love you.

51:15.656 --> 51:17.909
Worst day of my life.

51:28.127 --> 51:30.796
Luke.

51:30.797 --> 51:32.799
I missed you so much.

51:34.592 --> 51:35.593
Yeah.

52:02.078 --> 52:03.371
We should go.

52:04.413 --> 52:05.705
Luke, please.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.499
I don't remember this.

52:07.500 --> 52:11.002
- You don't need to see this.
- What's he doing at our dock?

52:11.003 --> 52:12.879
Can we just go please?

52:12.880 --> 52:14.381
Please…

52:14.382 --> 52:16.008
Oh, God, Luke. Please.

52:20.596 --> 52:22.347
Will you marry me?

52:22.348 --> 52:25.183
Of course.

52:25.184 --> 52:28.353
He made her death about him.
It's selfish, is what it is.

52:28.354 --> 52:32.149
- If you say so. So who's Karen?
- Oh, God. She's a neighbor.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.694
Longest-serving member
of the Oakdale Avenue HOA,

52:35.695 --> 52:37.655
and she won't let you forget it.

52:38.281 --> 52:40.407
She would always leave these
little sticky notes on my door.

52:40.408 --> 52:43.243
- She was a very passive-aggressive woman.
- Okay. Here we are. Here we are.

52:43.244 --> 52:44.954
- Gimme some space.
- Sorry.

52:49.333 --> 52:52.919
Larry. I heard about the pretzels.

52:52.920 --> 52:54.379
Karen. You're still old.

52:54.380 --> 52:57.008
I'm 72 now, thank you very much.

52:57.675 --> 52:58.758
Yeah, no.

52:58.759 --> 53:01.845
Sorry,
it's just a weird age to be your happiest.

53:01.846 --> 53:04.431
- You remember when Jim died?
- That was your happiest?

53:04.432 --> 53:06.641
- When your husband died?
- Oh, Jim was a dear.

53:06.642 --> 53:10.396
But anyway, that summer when I went on
that pottery retreat with my friend Barb…

53:11.272 --> 53:12.439
Right.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.857
Well, Barb and I were lovers.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.901
Oh. I-I didn't--

53:15.902 --> 53:20.030
I went full lesbian for three months,
and it was fabulous.

53:20.031 --> 53:24.284
But then I came back and I had the kids,
and the grandkids

53:24.285 --> 53:28.747
and the church group, and I just went
back into that miserable old closet.

53:28.748 --> 53:30.624
Oh, that explains
why you were so mean to me.

53:30.625 --> 53:32.334
Oh, no. I just didn't like you.

53:32.335 --> 53:33.501
Right.

53:33.502 --> 53:35.462
I came around eventually.

53:35.463 --> 53:38.965
- You grow on people, Larry.
- Mm-hmm.

53:38.966 --> 53:40.092
I'm thinking…

53:42.011 --> 53:43.261
Paris Land.

53:43.262 --> 53:47.265
It's basically Paris in the '60s,
but they speak English with an accent.

53:47.266 --> 53:48.851
And they have civil rights.

53:49.477 --> 53:51.102
I take it you're waiting on Joan.

53:51.103 --> 53:52.729
No, she's already here.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.815
Ooh, shit week for Oakdale.

53:55.524 --> 53:58.276
- So where you guys going?
- It's complicated.

53:58.277 --> 54:00.362
- Oh, are you gay too?
- Mmm.

54:00.363 --> 54:03.324
- Honestly, that would be easier.
- Look at you.

54:04.951 --> 54:07.786
You seem so uncomfortable.

54:07.787 --> 54:09.245
- Mm-hmm.
- Nah.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.538
- I-I'm hot.
- Think about it.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.791
The worst thing in the world
has already happened to you.

54:12.792 --> 54:14.459
He wishes.

54:14.460 --> 54:17.212
- Do tell.
- So, girl, this is what happened.

54:17.213 --> 54:19.339
Okay. L-Listen,
I came here to ask a question,

54:19.340 --> 54:21.007
and goddamn it,
I'm gonna ask Karen a question.

54:21.008 --> 54:22.301
Then ask the question.

54:23.177 --> 54:27.890
Karen, did Joan ever mention, um…

54:29.016 --> 54:30.768
Why do you think she fell in love with me?

54:35.147 --> 54:37.357
- Uh…
- Karen, say something.

54:37.358 --> 54:40.735
- Anything. Just say something.
- Well, I…

54:40.736 --> 54:43.321
- Um…
- Anything.

54:43.322 --> 54:46.199
I don't know.
She just did.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.410
I mean, I-I never thought

54:48.411 --> 54:50.870
she'd be happy again after Luke died…

54:50.871 --> 54:52.580
…but you made her happy.

54:52.581 --> 54:53.748
Mmm.

54:53.749 --> 54:56.459
You made your life about making her happy.

54:56.460 --> 54:59.254
- Isn't that enough?
- Eh.

54:59.255 --> 55:00.797
Luke is here.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.590
- Joan's Luke?
- Mm-hmm.

55:02.591 --> 55:06.011
Oh, he was so dreamy.

55:06.012 --> 55:07.971
I used to pretend I fancied him.

55:07.972 --> 55:10.765
- Of course, I didn't.
- Because you're a big, secret lesbian?

55:10.766 --> 55:11.975
- Exactly.
- Mmm.

55:11.976 --> 55:12.977
But, wow.

55:13.811 --> 55:14.894
He was perfect.

55:14.895 --> 55:16.771
Hey, listen to me.

55:16.772 --> 55:17.940
No one is perfect.

55:18.649 --> 55:19.733
No one is perfect!

55:19.734 --> 55:22.445
- Larry, don't be like that!
- No one is perfect!

55:23.029 --> 55:25.865
- Luke. Luke, would you calm down?
- About what?

55:26.532 --> 55:28.908
You know, if you just…

55:28.909 --> 55:32.287
If you think about it,
it was his way of saying

55:32.288 --> 55:34.497
that-that he knew that you
would always be a part of me.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.958
Come on, Joan. He wormed his way in.

55:36.959 --> 55:39.044
He manipulated you by using your grief.

55:39.045 --> 55:40.170
- No.
- He is such a leech.

55:40.171 --> 55:42.089
That is not what happened, okay?

55:42.757 --> 55:43.799
You left.

55:46.010 --> 55:47.178
I didn't leave. I died.

55:53.642 --> 55:56.270
Would you have said yes
if you weren't still grieving?

55:57.104 --> 55:59.315
I never stopped grieving.

56:01.901 --> 56:03.319
Would you say yes?

56:17.500 --> 56:19.292
Larry, Larry! Listen.

56:19.293 --> 56:21.920
I am rooting for you,
but this is not the way, okay?

56:21.921 --> 56:24.339
It's not even about him.
This is about you and Joan.

56:24.340 --> 56:27.300
The woman who you have loved
for 65 beautiful years,

56:27.301 --> 56:29.260
and have made her very happy.

56:29.261 --> 56:32.013
This is about showing that same woman
that you're willing

56:32.014 --> 56:35.225
to spend all of eternity together
to do the same thing.

56:35.226 --> 56:37.770
Now, is this gonna make her happy?

56:39.647 --> 56:40.939
- Okay, cool.
- What kind of creep

56:40.940 --> 56:41.898
leaves their door unlocked?

56:41.899 --> 56:45.360
- Maybe he doesn't have anything to hide.
- Nah, everybody's got something to hide.

56:47.279 --> 56:48.447
That's a little dramatic.

56:49.031 --> 56:51.282
It's actually really hard to keep
track of time here, so I applaud him.

56:51.283 --> 56:53.201
It's very practical.

56:53.202 --> 56:55.037
Larry, come on.

56:56.622 --> 56:58.790
Ha! Does a perfect person look at this?

56:58.791 --> 57:00.668
You've never looked at porn before, Larry?

57:03.170 --> 57:05.672
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah. What about this?

57:05.673 --> 57:07.215
Look at all these numbers.

57:07.216 --> 57:09.467
- Yeah, it's numbers.
- That one's got lipstick.

57:09.468 --> 57:11.010
- Mm-hmm.
- That means they're kissing.

57:11.011 --> 57:14.265
Yeah, it's been 67 years.
What would you do?

57:16.225 --> 57:19.435
Larry, come on. This is enough.
It's too much.

57:19.436 --> 57:21.729
Yeah. What am I doing? Let's go.

57:21.730 --> 57:23.274
- Let's just go.
- What the…

57:24.024 --> 57:25.567
You goddamn snake.

57:25.568 --> 57:27.652
Well, clearly the date
didn't go too well, did it?

57:27.653 --> 57:28.987
Oh, you took advantage of her.

57:28.988 --> 57:30.363
What're you talking about?

57:30.364 --> 57:33.116
You made your engagement about me.

57:33.117 --> 57:35.160
You used my death to worm your way in.

57:35.161 --> 57:37.579
- I don't have to listen to this.
- I felt awful leaving Joan alone.

57:37.580 --> 57:39.497
I genuinely hoped she would find someone.

57:39.498 --> 57:40.790
Yeah, right.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.960
But she woulda been
better off alone than with you.

57:43.544 --> 57:45.337
Well, I tried.

57:48.257 --> 57:50.008
Hey, is that hair dye?

57:52.887 --> 57:54.138
Stop!

57:55.681 --> 57:56.682
My nose!

57:59.768 --> 58:00.852
Get off of me!

58:00.853 --> 58:02.061
- Get off me!
- Get off me.

58:02.062 --> 58:04.648
That's it? That's all y'all can do?

58:07.902 --> 58:09.569
I didn't betray you, Luke.

58:09.570 --> 58:11.571
I didn't even know you.

58:11.572 --> 58:16.702
Yeah. Then why did you propose
at the dock?

58:20.122 --> 58:21.497
Larry.

58:21.498 --> 58:24.751
Trauma specialists
to Junction 145.

58:24.752 --> 58:26.044
Plane crash incoming.

58:26.045 --> 58:27.253
Baby formula. Here.

58:27.254 --> 58:28.880
- Sir…
- We also do breast milk.

58:30.132 --> 58:31.716
- Just a minute of your time. Please!
- Okay.

58:31.717 --> 58:33.676
- L-Let's get you somewhere quiet.
- Oh, God.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.888
- Bromance World.
- Why won't anybody come to Library World?

58:42.186 --> 58:44.939
Final call for High School World.

58:47.900 --> 58:49.735
What's wrong with these eternities?

58:50.736 --> 58:53.029
Oh, some are full.

58:53.030 --> 58:56.658
- Others are just out of fashion.
- Hmm.

58:56.659 --> 59:00.995
Quite a few of them weren't very PC by
today's standards.

59:00.996 --> 59:02.080
If that makes any sense.

59:02.081 --> 59:05.959
So, like, what happened to
the people inside of them?

59:05.960 --> 59:09.505
They are still in there
living out their afterlives.

59:10.923 --> 59:11.966
Right.

59:17.513 --> 59:18.806
Oh, God.

59:19.723 --> 59:22.268
I don't know what to do.

59:24.395 --> 59:28.439
You spent your entire life
worrying about other people.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.359
Now it's time to decide
what's best for you.

59:31.360 --> 59:32.361
Let me guess.

59:33.904 --> 59:35.364
Luke is best for me?

59:36.240 --> 59:39.743
I want you to choose Luke
because it's the life you missed.

59:40.869 --> 59:43.247
Eternity is a long time to have regrets.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.543
But that's your decision to make.

59:48.043 --> 59:50.336
Oh, God.

59:50.337 --> 59:53.840
What if I… What if I…
I don't know what to choose?

59:53.841 --> 59:55.801
Well, you need to figure it out.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.012
Sorry.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:08.188
Just have fun at the beach tomorrow.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.899
It is a paradise after all.

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:19.700
I didn't think it would be this busy.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:24.245
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Very popular. It's okay.

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.872
Wonder if we can get an umbrella.

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:29.126
Yeah, you'd think that they would
hand one to you, huh? Or a chair?

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.216
Look at the view.

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:45.016
You were so beautiful, honey.

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:46.351
Oh.

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:48.728
I mean, you are beautiful.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:51.606
And you've always been beautiful,

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:54.484
- you never stopped being beautiful.
- I get what you mean, love.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.656
You are right though.
This would've been a nice vacation.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.992
I mean, it doesn't have to be here.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:05.204
If you want another eternity, we can…

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:07.789
We can go to space for all I care.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:09.750
As long as Luke's not floating around.

01:01:18.384 --> 01:01:20.552
You look pretty good yourself.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:24.555
Fore!

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:26.015
That's golf, idiot!

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.350
Okay, Larry, it's a child.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.893
Oh, he's-he's probably 90.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.354
I actually died when I was nine.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.688
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.483
- Right.
- Hit and run.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.692
Least it was quick.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.694
It was not quick.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.490
It was very, very slow.

01:01:42.491 --> 01:01:44.535
- Oh.
- Get. Get.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.161
Hon, why don't we…
why don't we just get out of here.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:48.205
Okay.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.753
How was my funeral?

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.171
Decent turnout?

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:59.507
Yeah, you would've liked it.

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:00.591
Really?

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:03.094
Well, I mean, you would've
pretended to hate it, but it was nice.

01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:07.558
Zach did the eulogy.

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.809
Did he try to be funny?

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:13.480
Yeah, he did. He did try to be funny.
But, you know, it was sweet.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:16.567
The kids were-were so devastated.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.611
Who was the most devastated?

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:24.283
I'm not answering that.

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:29.788
Sweetie,
I'm sorry I wasn't there when you…

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:32.374
You know.

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:36.086
Yeah, but you were
waiting for me when I arrived.

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.677
The kids will be happy
that we're together.

01:02:52.311 --> 01:02:53.519
Larry.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.521
Mmm?

01:02:56.190 --> 01:03:00.068
You have to understand
that I'm in an impossible situation.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.324
No. I don't understand.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.159
I understand you loved Luke.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.161
I loved Sally Daniels in the ninth grade.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:12.747
He wasn't some childhood crush, Larry.
He was my husband.

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:15.917
Yeah, but we built a life together,
and now you just wanna throw it all away.

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:19.170
Well, I never had a chance
to start a life with Luke, and…

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:22.089
- you know, God, he waited 67--
- Sixty-seven years.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.217
Yeah, I get it.
I would've done the same thing.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:26.260
Well, you knew I was close.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:28.847
I was ready to wait
for as long as it took.

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.683
I was.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:35.687
It's getting late.
We should head back, okay, honey?

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:42.527
You're an idiot, Larry.

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:43.903
Okay, hold on.

01:03:43.904 --> 01:03:45.404
I'm holding on.

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:47.573
- You gotta shift your weight.
- Okay, okay.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:50.244
- Just don't hurt yourself, please.
- I know, but you're gonna tip us.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.416
♪ I can't forget you ♪

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:00.963
♪ I've got these memories of you ♪

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:05.634
♪ I can't forget you ♪

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:10.389
♪ I'll always be loving you ♪

01:04:11.557 --> 01:04:15.352
♪ Once we were happy ♪

01:04:15.978 --> 01:04:18.604
♪ We were so carefree and gay ♪

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:19.981
Come on, I wanna see the kids.

01:04:19.982 --> 01:04:21.774
But you take a wrong turn
in one of those things,

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:23.484
you could be stuck in
your worst nightmare.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:26.571
Okay, what… Forget about it.
I just… I thought it could be fun.

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:28.573
I-I know. I'm just…
I'm-I'm trying to protect you.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:31.200
No, you are protecting yourself.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.452
What're you so afraid you'll see?

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:34.704
Hmm?

01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:36.122
It doesn't matter. It's fine.

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.082
- You don't know what's going--
- Honey, it's okay.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.709
Gonna happen in there.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.253
Wait. Joan… I…

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:43.630
Look. They look miserable.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:56.226
Larry, do you remember our first date?

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:58.769
The flat.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:01.148
When we pulled over,
do you remember what you said?

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.860
You said that, "This is
the perfect place for a flat tire.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:08.488
Wide shoulder, beautiful day, quiet road."

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.742
Till I realized I didn't have a spare.

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:14.494
Yeah, well, you never let me know it.

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.956
You seemed so broken back then, honey.

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:21.877
I-I felt like I needed
to be strong for you.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:24.546
I just wanted to make everything okay.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:27.883
Right down to that flat tire.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:30.135
And you did make everything okay.

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:33.680
We had a wonderful life together.

01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:43.357
Come here.

01:06:05.087 --> 01:06:06.962
I don't care where we end up.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.924
Just as long as we're together.

01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:19.475
Okay.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.977
- So, uh, what-what's what's going on?
- What is…

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.062
Yeah, what're you guys--

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:24.855
I think it's important you hear
what Luke has to say.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:25.940
I'm so sorry, Larry.

01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:28.776
You should be, 'cause after
Larry broke into my apartment, I--

01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:31.237
- After he what?
- No, the door was open.

01:06:31.238 --> 01:06:32.405
- Was it?
- Jesus, Larry.

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:34.824
- Not a big deal.
- What is your… Sorry, what is that?

01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:36.992
- Do the honors.
- Okay. Look, that I can ex…

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.245
- I can explain. It's okay.
- It sounds way worse than it is.

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:40.955
- "Dear Jo, I…" No.
- No. Give it to me.

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:42.331
We don't need to do this right now.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.041
- Honey… Just give me…
- Joanie, I just wanted you to know

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:46.085
- the truth about this man.
- Hey, I can… Let me talk--

01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:48.045
Oh, go grovel.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:52.091
Just… Okay. I know,
but it-it-it's out of context, honey.

01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:53.259
Yes, it is.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.720
I'm sorry, you said that…

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.888
that you were willing
to wait as long as it took,

01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:59.765
but you-you couldn't
even last a measly week?

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:01.058
I was. I honest… I…

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:03.060
Um, I was trying
to set up our eternity, and--

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:04.603
And you just assumed
that I would come find you?

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:05.896
Well, yeah, because you're my wife.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:10.359
I'm sorry, you were… you were really
willing to trick me into an eternity?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.528
No, swe… I wasn't trying
to trick you, okay? I honestly…

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.447
I swear to God,
I thought I was doing the right thing.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:17.867
God. And to think
I was killing myself over this.

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:19.202
And you-you…

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:24.206
God, you-you are so selfish!

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:25.374
- I'm being selfish?
- Yeah.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.418
You are being selfish, because you're here

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:29.421
trying to decide between a man buffet of…

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.130
men.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:34.258
And I guarantee you've
already slept with Mr. Perfect over here.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.302
- I'm not perfect.
- As a matter of fact, I haven't.

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:37.511
But you know what?

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:39.305
Yeah, I've thought about it.

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:43.225
I mean, who wouldn't want
that kind of fiery, sparky love?

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.644
- Hell yeah.
- No.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.105
I guess everyone's been right then.

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:49.231
About what, Larry?

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.902
That you never loved me
the way that you loved him.

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:55.238
That I was just a consolation prize.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:04.498
Well, I, uh…

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:09.001
I know he would never lie to me.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:10.085
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.796
Do you know that he dyes his hair?

01:08:11.797 --> 01:08:14.340
And do you know that he's got
a-a worryingly large porn collection?

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:15.466
Oh, Jesus Christ, Larry.

01:08:15.467 --> 01:08:17.343
I know about the Playboy s in the garage.

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:18.886
Coasters, coasters.
Tell her about the coasters.

01:08:18.887 --> 01:08:20.012
Yes, and the coasters.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:22.848
He's got a, uh, a basket of coasters
with ladies' numbers on 'em.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.183
Okay… What is he talking about?

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:26.018
What is he talking about?
He's talking about breaking and entering.

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:28.229
No, see. He's being… He's very…

01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:29.772
- He's slippery.
- Oh, yeah?

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.732
He's a snake
and he's being purposefully vague.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.484
Yeah, like how he was with "the war."

01:08:33.485 --> 01:08:35.027
Ignore them, Luke. You're perfect.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:42.368
- He's unhinged.
- You okay, babe?

01:08:42.369 --> 01:08:45.871
I'm not perfect, okay? Yes, I dye my hair.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:49.166
And yes, I slept with a few
women over the last 60 years.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.835
Oh, okay. I mean, that's understandable.

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:53.212
And one guy. One guy.

01:08:53.213 --> 01:08:54.797
- Don't lie.
- Two.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.257
Two guys. Just to see. Both times.

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:59.468
And I went through that BDSM phase
about 30 years ago--

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.053
Yes, you did.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:02.555
Yeah, me too.

01:09:02.556 --> 01:09:03.681
Was fun, but n-not for me.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:06.350
I didn't expect you to be
a-a priest for so long--

01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:09.061
And I think I was beginning
to bald when I died. I-I-I comb it over.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.438
Whatever. You keep saying I'm perfect,
you keep saying I'm perfect,

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.191
everyone keeps saying I'm perfect.
I am not perfect. Nobody is perfect.

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:15.651
Finally. Thank you.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:16.695
But I did wait.

01:09:17.404 --> 01:09:19.281
I waited for you, Joanie.

01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:24.368
He should at least lose
some points for all the sex.

01:09:24.369 --> 01:09:26.203
God, this is not a competition, Larry.

01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:27.788
- Yes, it is!
- Sweetheart.

01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:29.957
- It is 100%, for sure a competition.
- It is in fact a competition.

01:09:29.958 --> 01:09:32.586
- That's literally what we're here for.
- Look, Joan.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:37.131
I'm done with the games. You need
to decide if it's me or if it's him.

01:09:37.132 --> 01:09:38.717
Yeah, you need to make a decision.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.135
- Who's it gonna be?
- Which one?

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:43.470
It's gotta be one of us.
You gotta pick.

01:09:43.471 --> 01:09:46.098
I-I think we need to give
my client some time to think.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.560
Let's just go for a walk.
Let her breathe a little.

01:09:52.355 --> 01:09:54.481
Let's get you boys something to drink.

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:56.276
A drink sounds nice, right?

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:57.777
Something stiff.

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:29.768
God.

01:10:33.772 --> 01:10:34.856
Yeah?

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:37.275
I heard you kicked it too.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.989
Sweetie…

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.368
Oh…

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:53.291
Well, I guess there's nothing more
we can do. It's up to her.

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.304
Can I have one of them?

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:11.434
Just relax and get your mind
off those boys.

01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:13.769
We deserve this.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.938
You know what's funny about you being here

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:18.691
is that you actually knew me
when I was with both of them.

01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:20.067
Oh, for Christ's sake, Joan.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.527
- Drink.
- Oh, sure.

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:23.320
Just… Mmm.

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:27.324
- I got a toast. This one is for Korea.
- Yeah, you're damn right.

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:29.160
Not enough films made about it.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:31.705
Well, except M*A*S*H .

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:35.207
What the hell's M*A*S*H ?

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.126
Ah, man. You gotta watch M*A*S*H .

01:11:37.127 --> 01:11:39.754
Then I choose Luke.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:41.798
- Okay.
- No.

01:11:42.674 --> 01:11:43.675
Larry.

01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:47.094
Larry. Okay.

01:11:47.095 --> 01:11:49.013
God, shitty shit!

01:11:49.014 --> 01:11:50.347
I'm so sorry.

01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:56.061
- I don't think you're going bald.
- What're you talking about?

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.146
No. It can…

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.732
You can easily pass that off
as a double crown.

01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:01.066
You know what? I appreciate that.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.776
A-And you're pretty handsome yourself.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.403
You don't… You don't have to say that.

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:07.031
You're a catch.
Y-Y-You got that mysterious thing.

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:10.325
Like, "I'm thinking deep stuff."
And women, they're into that.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.495
Really? 'Cause I'm not. I mean, honestly.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:16.206
I've been dead, and I haven't once
thought about the meaning of life.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.751
They're like, "This is it." and I'm like,
"Yeah, that makes sense to me."

01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:20.377
You're smart. Don't overthink it.

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:23.464
You know who you are, you know
what you want, and you go and get it.

01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:25.716
You start thinking about
all the infinite possibilities,

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:27.968
and guess what? You never move.

01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:30.220
- She doesn't deserve you.
- And she doesn't deserve you.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:33.307
You are smart, you are handsome,
and you're a war hero.

01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:34.808
And you gave her kids.

01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:37.186
- I did.
- I bet you looked after 'em well.

01:12:37.187 --> 01:12:39.189
- Yeah, I did.
- Salud.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:43.442
And at first, it was about Luke and me.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:46.111
And then there were decisions
about Larry and me.

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:49.573
- And, you know, it was about the kids.
- Are you considering this eternity?

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:52.827
And, you know, work.
But this one is about me.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:54.370
And…

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:58.916
You are dead.

01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:01.502
- Jesus, Karen.
- You lived your life,

01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:02.836
and now you're dead.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:06.131
You have no obligations to anyone.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.634
Maybe it's best you
all have a clean slate.

01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:12.346
Uh, i-it's just we have others interested,
and I feel--

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:14.432
A little less of this,
a little more of this.

01:13:15.517 --> 01:13:16.600
Thank you, honey.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.811
- Thank you.
- You can go.

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:20.105
It's just…

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:23.398
- She's a…
- She's a perfect person.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.193
She's a perfect person.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:32.992
Come here.

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:50.718
Coming!

01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:08.570
Do we have a little headache this morning?

01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:12.197
I've made my decision.

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.699
Okay.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.494
I'll gather your husbands.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.495
I need a shower.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:20.456
Yeah. You do.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:23.834
I'm so nervous. Are you guys nervous?

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.669
You should definitely be nervous.
You too. Not to…

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.671
Not to mean that you should be
more nervous than anybody else,

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.506
but I'm just saying there's
a lot of nerves going all around.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.300
- Hey. Why are you talking so fast?
- Are you nervous?

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:33.010
Oh, my gosh. 'Cause I'm nervous.

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:35.179
You guys should both be
shitting yourselves right now.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.306
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.692
My client has reached her decision.

01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:56.533
Love is a bond greater than death.

01:14:56.534 --> 01:14:58.076
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:02.581
But some bonds are, well,
better bonded.

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:06.210
You have your ionic bonds,
you have your covalent bonds.

01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:07.377
Your savings bonds.

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:09.755
- Bail bonds. You--
- Yeah. Okay. That's good.

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.465
- That's great. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:12.634
Okay.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.430
Okay.

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:21.017
So, Larry.

01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:23.686
My first morning without you, I…

01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:26.605
God, I hoped it was a bad dream.

01:15:26.606 --> 01:15:29.691
I-I smelled your toast burning downstairs.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:30.776
I…

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:33.111
I heard the rattle of the back door and…

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:35.113
You know, I even…

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:38.116
I even threw your pillows
on the ground the way…

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.536
the way you always did and…

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:42.872
You know, I was pretending…

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.083
It's okay, honey.

01:15:46.084 --> 01:15:49.711
And,
uh, the funny thing is…

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.880
is that I… I felt that before.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.465
When, uh…

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:55.843
When Luke died.

01:15:57.679 --> 01:16:01.975
We never had a chance
to see where our love would take us.

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:07.981
But you gave me everything
that I needed in the time we had.

01:16:09.941 --> 01:16:10.942
Yeah.

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:14.236
So…

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:15.613
God, how lucky am I…

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:19.742
…to have had you both,
you know?

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:27.417
And, uh, maybe things worked out
the way they were meant to.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.003
Hmm.

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:33.213
S-So, what are you…
What are you saying? I don't…

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:37.635
I'm saying, um…

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:40.680
that I choose…

01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:49.355
I choose neither of you.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.774
- You choose neither of us?
- You're kidding, right?

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.568
So, you're gonna hurt
three people instead of one?

01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:57.404
No, there was never going to… to be one.

01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:58.531
Don't you get it?

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:02.492
I was going to be crushed either way.

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:04.328
But we built a life together.

01:17:04.329 --> 01:17:07.582
Well, yeah.
Maybe the beauty in life is that…

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:10.376
Is that things end.

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:14.964
You know? Maybe that's what…
…this is all for.

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:16.758
So…

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:22.347
So, I choose neither of you.

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.976
Yeah. Okay.

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:11.521
Why do we even bother? I mean, do we help?

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:15.440
- Do we make a difference?
- Of course we make a difference.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.067
We annoy them.

01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:18.527
They've just died.

01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:19.695
They're scared.

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:23.199
It's better to be
annoyed than to be scared.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:24.700
Right?

01:18:34.836 --> 01:18:36.295
You sure about this?

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.631
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.843
Well, let's go.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:50.309
You were right, by the way.
Even my proposal was about you.

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:53.855
You were the ghost
I could never compete with.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.398
No.

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:59.360
Do you have any idea
how jealous I am of you?

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.488
You got to have a life with her.

01:19:05.158 --> 01:19:07.952
Hey, you know you were
the last thing I saw before I died?

01:19:09.537 --> 01:19:10.788
What do you mean?

01:19:11.581 --> 01:19:15.959
I was eating a pretzel
and my great-granddaughter--

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.961
- Charlotte?
- Yeah.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:22.717
Shows me this old picture
of you and Joan on your wedding day.

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:25.178
And then I started choking.

01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:39.191
Yeah. I gotta admit,
you weren't who I was expecting.

01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:40.776
You're exactly what I was expecting.

01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:44.280
Minus the porn and hair dye.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:50.160
About six months before I died, I was…

01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:54.332
I was graying at the temples
and, you know, I just didn't care.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:20:00.671
'Cause Joan and I, we'd just had
this conversation about starting a family.

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:06.427
Everything was laid out in front of us.

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:10.515
That was my happiest.

01:20:15.228 --> 01:20:16.354
I'm 35.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:23.110
Joan was pregnant with our second
and we went out to dinner one night.

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:27.322
The doctor was telling us
about all these new studies

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.492
where you're not supposed to drink
when you're pregnant.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:34.038
And I got my glass of wine
and Joan took a sip of it,

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.668
and she just had this
little smile on her face.

01:20:39.794 --> 01:20:46.592
And I don't know but, in that moment,
it just felt like we were a team.

01:20:58.896 --> 01:20:59.980
You okay?

01:20:59.981 --> 01:21:02.441
Oh, my God. I have to go.

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:13.201
What's going on?

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:14.578
Your AC will explain everything.

01:21:14.579 --> 01:21:16.163
What's an AC?

01:21:29.427 --> 01:21:33.054
We can go to this café on the Seine
where a fake Sartre

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:37.852
and fake Camus have a fight
and they have great pain au chocolat .

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:40.979
Was Camus the one
who always talked about death?

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.398
'Cause that just kinda
sounds pointless now.

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:44.733
Really?

01:21:44.734 --> 01:21:47.612
You know, I read Sartre For Beginners .

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.447
How do you say Sartre?

01:21:50.448 --> 01:21:52.324
- Sar… Sartre.
- Sartre.

01:21:52.325 --> 01:21:53.534
And--

01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:55.327
What's Larry doing here?

01:21:55.328 --> 01:21:56.329
I…

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:10.467
- Please. Larry. I made up my mind, okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:13.471
- You know this is best. Okay?
- Your hair is different.

01:22:15.014 --> 01:22:17.557
- Okay. Thank you.
- No.

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:20.644
Y-You never had it like that
when we were together.

01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:22.688
No. I-I cut it after…

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:26.692
It suits you.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:28.944
Larry.

01:22:30.488 --> 01:22:31.739
You should go with Luke.

01:22:32.907 --> 01:22:36.202
Okay? You deserve a shot
at that kind of love, honey.

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:40.122
That fiery, sparky kind.

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:44.877
But I was
so, so happy with you.

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.463
I… I know.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.049
But you were happiest with him.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:55.095
- It's okay.
- B-But what… What about you?

01:22:57.056 --> 01:22:59.600
D-Don't worry about me.
I'll be in the sun.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:03.228
Knowing you're happy makes me happy.

01:23:05.064 --> 01:23:07.400
But it doesn't work unless you're happy.

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:11.278
Oh, Larry.

01:23:23.124 --> 01:23:24.207
Okay.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:27.211
You better go break the news
to Karen.

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:29.130
Okay.

01:23:30.881 --> 01:23:31.882
Okay.

01:23:34.969 --> 01:23:36.929
- Okay.
- It's the right thing.

01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:38.889
Wow.

01:25:03.891 --> 01:25:07.520
The train doors
will close in 30 minutes.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:10.647
Babe, we shouldn't flaunt
our sexy love in front of his face.

01:25:10.648 --> 01:25:12.190
He has no one.

01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:13.483
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.110
How are you holding up, Lar?

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.154
Eh, I'm all right.

01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.156
No hard feelings, right, Larry?

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:22.992
For what it's worth, I totally thought
you had it there for a moment.

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:24.161
Thanks.

01:25:25.538 --> 01:25:27.747
What's this? Are you two together now?

01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:31.084
- Yeah.
- We're gonna give it another go.

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:32.210
Good.

01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:35.213
You really showed us that living
without someone is a hollow mess.

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:37.173
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:38.800
- Okay.
- Give us a minute, please.

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:41.469
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.
I miss you already.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.430
God.

01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:46.892
You wanna?

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.738
I gotta say,
I'm really proud of you, Larry.

01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:02.157
You're doing the right thing.

01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:04.660
I feel terrible.

01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:07.538
Yeah. That happens.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.666
Sometimes doing the right thing
does feel terrible.

01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:16.338
So, you never told me why
you ended up staying here.

01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:20.593
Um, coming here…

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:26.765
I'll just say that coming here
was an improvement for me.

01:26:28.017 --> 01:26:32.021
Here, I get to help lost souls
find their happiness.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.690
And that gives me a sense of purpose.

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:39.445
But after time, you stop caring
about what's best for people.

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:41.738
You're just pushing them along

01:26:41.739 --> 01:26:45.700
and making sure the afterlife
is ticking over, you know?

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:46.827
Sell, sell, sell.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.749
But then you came along.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.753
Yeah. With that great ordinary love.

01:26:57.463 --> 01:27:00.257
And you reminded me
of why I chose this place.

01:27:01.175 --> 01:27:03.218
So, thank you for that, Larry.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.474
Well, I guess you're welcome.

01:27:14.063 --> 01:27:15.439
So…

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:20.778
have you chosen your eternity?

01:27:24.198 --> 01:27:26.492
Yeah, I think I have.

01:27:38.796 --> 01:27:40.421
- Okay. Come on.
- What?

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:42.298
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:44.301
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:27:45.511 --> 01:27:46.512
Oh, boy.

01:27:47.554 --> 01:27:48.806
- Oh.
- Hey.

01:27:49.515 --> 01:27:51.307
- Yeah.
- It's not bad, huh?

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.351
Oh, it's…

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.271
It's very charming.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:01.902
Shit.

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:04.070
- A car crash.
- Oh.

01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:06.073
Uh, old age. Cancer.

01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:09.200
- War.
- Oh. War. Which one?

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.953
- I or II?
- Um, Korea.

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:13.455
- Which counts. Yeah.
- Oh.

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:23.339
Well done.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.341
Thank you.

01:28:30.556 --> 01:28:32.641
I love you so much.

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:34.977
So much.

01:29:14.516 --> 01:29:16.476
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:29:16.477 --> 01:29:19.646
Uh, so you like books?

01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:23.566
Uh, yeah. I'm a librarian, so…

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:24.901
Can I help you with something?

01:29:24.902 --> 01:29:26.360
Yeah. I can read.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:28.404
That's good.
You're in the right place.

01:29:28.405 --> 01:29:31.533
- What's that one?
- That's Dickens, Great Expectations .

01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:33.327
Any good?

01:29:34.203 --> 01:29:36.329
Um, you know, I haven't read it.

01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:38.664
But that's
'cause I don't really love Dickens.

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.041
- Oh.
- It's a big controversy.

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:42.836
Yeah. I hate him.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.047
You got a… You got a nice laugh.

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:47.591
Oh, thank you.

01:29:50.344 --> 01:29:51.928
- I'm Joan.
- Larry.

01:29:51.929 --> 01:29:53.763
- Nice to meet you, Larry.
- Nice to meet you.

01:29:53.764 --> 01:29:55.766
Okay.

01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:59.685
Okay.

01:29:59.686 --> 01:30:01.563
- That's it, slow and steady.
- Okay.

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:04.440
Okay.

01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:06.109
Keep up the good work, Joan.

01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:08.402
Oh, yeah. Thanks, Simon.
Go fuck yourself.

01:30:10.197 --> 01:30:11.906
- It's good.
- Yeah, really good.

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:13.407
- Oh, it feels good.
- Come on, let's go.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:14.409
Okay.

01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:24.711
What is that?

01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:27.338
Who's that?

01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:31.759
How is it that he already
needs to poop again?

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.678
Four months old
and he's already shitting like a man.

01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:34.847
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.

01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:37.390
- Oh, honey.
- What's that?

01:30:37.391 --> 01:30:38.392
You stink.

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:45.398
Janet, Connor. Connor, Janet.

01:30:45.399 --> 01:30:48.109
- They died doing a… What--
- Gender reveal party.

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:50.153
- Yeah. Gender reveal party.
- Yeah. There was so much blood.

01:30:50.154 --> 01:30:51.571
Everywhere. Just oozing.

01:30:51.572 --> 01:30:53.406
We didn't see it coming.
We'd al… We looked in.

01:30:53.407 --> 01:30:54.907
We were like,
"Oh, what's going on in here?"

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:56.325
Boom! Blew our heads right off.

01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:57.703
- I love it when you do that.
- Whoa.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:05.752
Thank you, Fenwick.

01:31:14.094 --> 01:31:16.762
Are you sure you don't wanna come?
The powder's fresh, J-Bae.

01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:18.681
Oh, I got plenty of powder yesterday.

01:31:18.682 --> 01:31:20.766
- Powdered out. So…
- You sure?

01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:22.810
- Uh-huh. Have fun.
- Okay. Give me a kiss.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:23.895
- Okay.
- I love you.

01:31:23.896 --> 01:31:25.479
- I love you too. Bye.
- Bye.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.481
Cute.

01:31:28.192 --> 01:31:29.651
You sure?

01:31:34.907 --> 01:31:39.578
You know, people die at these things?
I saw it on the Internet.

01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:44.207
- It's a gender reveal party.
- They're lethal and stupid.

01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:46.083
Oh, just let 'em make a fuss.

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:49.503
I mean, I get, you know,
eliminating the surprise

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:51.005
but it's not party-worthy.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:52.965
You know, one
of the great joys of my life

01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:54.634
has been allowing for surprises.

01:31:54.635 --> 01:31:58.596
Remember when you were convinced
that Zach was a girl?

01:31:58.597 --> 01:32:01.390
Well, everything has
to be a party nowadays.

01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:03.643
- You hate parties.
- Everything has to be an event.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:05.895
No, no. You hate having fun.

01:32:05.896 --> 01:32:08.064
You know, kids have
preschool graduations now.

01:32:08.065 --> 01:32:09.775
You haven't achieved anything yet.

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:13.237
Can we just… Can we just enjoy it?

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.574
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Look, lady.

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:20.911
It's not too healthy to be
coming back here all the time.

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:23.997
It's important to move on.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:27.376
Mmm.

01:32:32.965 --> 01:32:34.216
This is perfect, huh?

01:32:36.385 --> 01:32:37.552
Huh?

01:32:41.932 --> 01:32:42.975
You're okay?

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.061
Yeah.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.480
- Yeah?
- Just a little cold.

01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:52.901
- Come on.
- Mmm.

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:10.377
I booked us on a hot air balloon later on.

01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:15.881
And, uh, there's a new couple
in… in unit nine.

01:33:15.882 --> 01:33:17.717
I think they'd, uh… Ooh.

01:33:17.718 --> 01:33:19.719
I think they'd make
great doubles partners.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.431
If I meet any more new people,
I'm going to explode.

01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:26.643
And then what would you complain about?

01:33:27.519 --> 01:33:28.853
- What?
- Come on, Joanie,

01:33:28.854 --> 01:33:30.314
you love to complain.

01:33:31.315 --> 01:33:33.608
That's not a thing people love.

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.362
You okay?

01:33:38.447 --> 01:33:39.990
I made a mistake.

01:33:41.992 --> 01:33:43.618
Did you lose your skis again?

01:33:47.039 --> 01:33:49.666
No. I, uh…

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:55.964
I made a mistake coming h-here with you.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:04.848
Okay.

01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:07.391
What'd I do wrong now?

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:12.563
Nothing. Oh, nothing. No, you're perfect.
I know you say you're not b-but you are.

01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:16.525
You're kind and brave and smart.
That's how I know.

01:34:16.526 --> 01:34:19.571
I waited all these years for this.

01:34:20.447 --> 01:34:21.448
This.

01:34:22.449 --> 01:34:25.618
Why can't you just enjoy it?
We're in a literal paradise.

01:34:25.619 --> 01:34:29.121
Yeah, I'm sorry
I didn't realize it sooner.

01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:30.790
I think I just… I think I just

01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:32.875
- got really caught up in everything.
- Joanie, what the…

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:35.002
And maybe it would've worked
between us in life.

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:36.087
You know? Maybe not.

01:34:36.088 --> 01:34:39.173
But I-I can't pretend that my world
didn't continue without you.

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:42.760
I am not asking you to.
I have never asked it of you.

01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:45.304
- Unlike you, I don't hide things.
- Well, what's that supposed to mean?

01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:49.309
I grit my teeth every single day
so you can go to that damn tunnel.

01:34:54.648 --> 01:34:57.566
Joanie, we were happiest together.

01:34:57.567 --> 01:34:59.361
Yeah. Of course we were.

01:34:59.945 --> 01:35:01.821
It was young love. It was…

01:35:01.822 --> 01:35:06.867
It was love without the burden
of a mortgage or a job or kids.

01:35:06.868 --> 01:35:09.954
It was, you know, the kind of love
you feel before knowing loss.

01:35:09.955 --> 01:35:11.581
It was everything, but…

01:35:12.958 --> 01:35:14.625
Love isn't just one happy moment.

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:16.293
Right? It's a million.

01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:21.132
And it's bickering in the car,
and supporting someone when they need it,

01:35:21.133 --> 01:35:24.260
and it's growing together,
and looking after each other.

01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:27.096
We can grow together now.
We can look after each other now.

01:35:27.097 --> 01:35:29.598
I mean, Luke. Honestly?

01:35:29.599 --> 01:35:31.810
Am I living up to the memory?

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:39.024
You waited so long in that…
that artificial place,

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:41.027
but here, this is real.

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:43.447
And… And you're living and…

01:35:44.156 --> 01:35:47.491
I'm giving you permission.
Go live without me.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:49.618
Oh, you're giving me permission? Are you…

01:35:49.619 --> 01:35:51.245
- Are you giving me permission?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:53.581
- That was a little condescending.
- Thank you so much, my Highness.

01:35:53.582 --> 01:35:54.832
- I'm your humble servant.
- Okay.

01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:57.210
- Thank you so much for the permission.
- I'm sorry.

01:35:59.463 --> 01:36:01.214
This is not fair.

01:36:04.843 --> 01:36:05.844
It's not fair.

01:36:07.304 --> 01:36:08.305
I know.

01:36:09.973 --> 01:36:10.974
But…

01:36:12.851 --> 01:36:13.976
I have to go back.

01:36:13.977 --> 01:36:15.561
You out of your mind?

01:36:15.562 --> 01:36:18.440
The moment you step through a red door,
they'll find you.

01:36:19.816 --> 01:36:21.735
They'll put you into the void.

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:23.361
I have to try.

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:27.824
No, you don't. You can stay here with me.

01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:33.663
Please stay.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.045
Please stay.

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:47.385
I'm sorry.

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:52.432
I really do love you.

01:37:37.686 --> 01:37:38.853
Okay.

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:44.733
Hands up, Fenwick. Give me the keys.
You got it, Joanie. You've got it, Joanie.

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:46.610
Yeah. Stick 'em up, stick 'em up.

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:47.736
Stick 'em up, Fenny.

01:37:47.737 --> 01:37:50.489
Are you ready to die, Fenny?
You want me to cut you? I'll cut…

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:51.574
Oh, God.

01:37:51.575 --> 01:37:53.450
Such a sweet boy. He's so sweet.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:56.245
Unless I do some… Okay. Yeah.

01:37:56.246 --> 01:37:57.872
You know that won't work.

01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:01.084
I mean…

01:38:02.502 --> 01:38:03.795
it might.

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:20.812
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:25.400
You're gonna need a distraction.

01:38:28.987 --> 01:38:30.572
Luke…

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:33.158
I'm so sorry.

01:38:34.117 --> 01:38:35.410
Yeah.

01:38:36.202 --> 01:38:37.245
I know.

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:46.671
So, you remember how
I used to do some local theater?

01:39:02.687 --> 01:39:06.148
Please don't touch the exhibits.
Remember the exhibits aren't real.

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:07.400
She left.

01:39:09.778 --> 01:39:13.031
- Why?
- Oh, buddy.

01:39:13.782 --> 01:39:16.450
I know. I know it's tough.

01:39:16.451 --> 01:39:17.660
I know, I know.

01:39:17.661 --> 01:39:19.286
But… B-But trust me, it'll get better.

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:23.248
It's okay. It's okay. Yeah, that's right.
J-Just let it out, big guy.

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:26.794
Let it out. Let it out. Let it all out.

01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:28.545
Okay? It's okay. It's okay.

01:39:28.546 --> 01:39:30.964
It's tough today,
b-but there's always tomorrow.

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:32.716
It's tough today,
there's always tomorrow, huh?

01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:34.635
- That's right. That's right. Okay.
- Okay, good.

01:39:34.636 --> 01:39:36.345
I just needed a good cry, I think.

01:39:36.346 --> 01:39:37.680
Yeah, I get that.

01:39:37.681 --> 01:39:39.682
- I remember when my old lady dumped--
- Anyway, thanks.

01:39:39.683 --> 01:39:42.811
I'm gonna pop in for, uh…
For old time's sake.

01:39:43.687 --> 01:39:45.605
Yeah, but y-you didn't take a ticket.

01:39:48.274 --> 01:39:50.485
I need to stop being such a giver.

01:40:03.873 --> 01:40:05.917
You should hurry up.

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:08.336
Yeah.

01:40:11.005 --> 01:40:12.132
Goodbye, Luke.

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:15.427
Goodbye, Joan.

01:40:18.638 --> 01:40:19.639
Yeah.

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:12.441
- Honey, it was the last time, I promise.
- No.

01:41:12.442 --> 01:41:14.985
Will you please just calm down
and let's discuss this?

01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:16.987
- Don't you dare tell me to calm down!
- There she is!

01:41:16.988 --> 01:41:18.071
Stop right there!

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:20.032
- You are not taking my child!
- What do you care?

01:41:20.033 --> 01:41:22.826
- Get in here right now!
- Stop her! Stop her!

01:41:22.827 --> 01:41:23.911
I hate you!

01:41:23.912 --> 01:41:25.413
…you would treat me like that?

01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:29.876
- What if I'm pregnant?
- It'll be okay, Joanie. I promise.

01:41:30.627 --> 01:41:32.002
I'm sorry, the check bounced.

01:41:32.003 --> 01:41:33.378
Please.

01:41:33.379 --> 01:41:34.922
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:37.967
There's nowhere to go!

01:41:38.551 --> 01:41:41.179
- We're sorry for your loss.
- No, no, no, no.

01:41:44.641 --> 01:41:46.726
Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up!

01:41:50.313 --> 01:41:51.314
Stop!

01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:01.032
Shit.

01:42:08.373 --> 01:42:09.623
Jesus, Larry. I don't wanna--

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:11.458
I don't wanna have
this conversation again. I am--

01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:13.752
No, I am not.
I am not comparing you to him!

01:42:13.753 --> 01:42:17.172
No, I have never compared you to him!
And I don't wanna have this conversation!

01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:18.507
It's humiliating, Joan.

01:42:18.508 --> 01:42:19.883
- I can't do this anymore.
- Don't move!

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:22.761
God, well, she brought it up.
What am I supposed to say?

01:42:22.762 --> 01:42:24.471
I mean, I… I get it. She doesn't like me.

01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.348
- No, no, she literally said…
- You'll grow on her.

01:42:26.349 --> 01:42:28.141
- …"I don't like him."
- You grow on people, Larry.

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:30.352
Great.
I'm like a fungus. I'm a mushroom.

01:42:58.298 --> 01:42:59.882
Upstairs! Upstairs!

01:42:59.883 --> 01:43:01.050
Larry.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.721
Hurry!

01:43:05.597 --> 01:43:08.348
Come on, get up. Grab her! Grab her!

01:43:18.985 --> 01:43:20.820
Okay.

01:43:43.176 --> 01:43:46.261
Train delay on Platform 186.

01:43:46.262 --> 01:43:48.056
Escapee on the tracks.

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:57.731
Excuse me. Hi.

01:43:57.732 --> 01:44:01.694
I-I need to know which eternity
Larry Cutler went to.

01:44:02.195 --> 01:44:05.364
Ma'am, there have been
425,000 Larry Cutlers.

01:44:05.365 --> 01:44:06.741
Could you be more specific?

01:44:11.037 --> 01:44:12.038
Oh.

01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:16.750
Shoot, oh, shoot, oh, shoot.

01:44:16.751 --> 01:44:20.046
Red door escapee.
Do not engage.

01:44:20.964 --> 01:44:21.965
Excuse me.

01:44:25.259 --> 01:44:28.054
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:44:29.806 --> 01:44:33.225
You know,
I've been thinking a lot about it and,

01:44:33.226 --> 01:44:37.562
you know, I-I think that maybe
we should consider being poly.

01:44:37.563 --> 01:44:40.315
I'm not much
of a multitasker, babe.

01:44:40.316 --> 01:44:41.858
- What?
- I'm a one-woman man.

01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:42.943
Oh, real--

01:44:42.944 --> 01:44:45.029
- Oh, my God.
- Watch where you're going, lady.

01:44:45.738 --> 01:44:47.365
Go over there. Over there.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.909
You guys see a woman
come running this way?

01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:53.078
- No.
- She went that way.

01:44:53.079 --> 01:44:54.871
- Thanks. Come on. Let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:44:54.872 --> 01:44:55.999
Good luck, you guys.

01:44:57.041 --> 01:44:58.167
Let's go. Move.

01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:00.377
Joan.

01:45:00.378 --> 01:45:02.254
You're such a romantic.

01:45:02.255 --> 01:45:04.881
We can sneak her into one
of those old, disused eternities.

01:45:04.882 --> 01:45:06.675
Not one of the racist ones.
But you'll be safe there.

01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:09.094
- Security never checks them.
- Where did he go?

01:45:09.095 --> 01:45:10.178
Who?

01:45:10.179 --> 01:45:11.555
Where's Larry?

01:45:11.556 --> 01:45:14.433
Oh, my God. I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it.

01:45:14.434 --> 01:45:17.020
Where is he?

01:45:47.842 --> 01:45:48.843
Oh.

01:45:50.595 --> 01:45:52.221
It's a lot out there, huh?

01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:55.058
Intense.

01:45:55.808 --> 01:45:56.809
Yeah.

01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:00.687
I know somewhere you could really unwind.

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:02.856
Come on, Marge. You know the rules.

01:46:02.857 --> 01:46:04.776
I'm just trying to help a girl out.

01:46:05.276 --> 01:46:06.819
I know what I want now.

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:10.530
I could show you my eternity.

01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:12.575
It's, uh, just around the corner.

01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:16.954
You heard the lady.

01:46:19.665 --> 01:46:21.417
I preferred the last barman.

01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:31.051
You look like you could use a drink.

01:46:31.052 --> 01:46:32.053
Oh.

01:46:34.347 --> 01:46:35.348
Yeah.

01:46:36.015 --> 01:46:37.517
You never left.

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:39.476
Nah.

01:46:39.477 --> 01:46:41.896
Sand really does get everywhere.

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:47.235
Yeah. Turns out
that the cold is just cold.

01:47:02.375 --> 01:47:04.751
- Is that for you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:47:04.752 --> 01:47:06.379
I'm kind of a fugitive.

01:47:07.004 --> 01:47:08.172
Where you gonna go?

01:47:10.174 --> 01:47:11.425
I know a place.

01:47:13.302 --> 01:47:14.554
It could be dangerous.

01:47:24.897 --> 01:47:26.481
When do we leave?

01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:56.637
Well, looks like Oakdale.

01:47:58.806 --> 01:47:59.807
It's perfect.
