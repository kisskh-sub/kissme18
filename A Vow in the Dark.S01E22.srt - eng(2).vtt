00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.070
My life is mine alone,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.710
not fate's to command.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.840
Jie Chuan.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.070
I'm fine.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.200
We've passed the illusion;

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.430
a clue will show.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.420
(The Dragon Ancestor is back)

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.940
(The Dragon Ancestor is back
with the Artifact)

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
The Dragon Ancestor is back
with the Artifact.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.020
(Serpent Immortal Temple)

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.580
Legend says

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.500
only the one who is
the Dragon Ancestor reborn

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.940
can restore the Artifact.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.920
But how do you know

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.150
he's in the Serpent Immortal Temple?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.320
Within the illusion

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.870
I was still conscious,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.710
came to this place,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.320
and spoke with the Dragon Ancestor.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.000
Dragon Ancestor? You met him?

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.360
They say the Dragon Ancestor
foresees all.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.360
As expected,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.400
he calculated every step.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.560
Do you think the conflict

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.470
ends so easily?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.840
Ji Li is fated to slay you;

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.680
its edge is honed.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.400
If you cannot settle her,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.840
how will you settle two worlds?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.870
Jie Chuan,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.280
if you don't kill Ji Li,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.310
you'll suffer the consequences.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.080
He foresees all?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.440
That doesn't matter to me.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.840
Yet now, when I'm with you,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.840
I cherish

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.840
every single instant.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.750
Wait.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.710
Ever since the last chaos
in Hunling City,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.120
Feng Tian

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.070
(Serpent Immortal Temple)
has sealed this area.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.960
Now,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.800
forcing it open

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.150
would need Demonic Ether.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.150
The best way is to use a mortal way

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.990
to open it.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.680
A mortal way?

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.200
Mortal strength?

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.150
Don't panic;

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.310
I have a plan.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.600
The tea-house hired a new storyteller.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.150
- Really?
- They say he's quite good.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.360
To get into the temple,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.100
let's just get a locksmith
to copy the key.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.960
That's your brilliant idea?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.680
Here's a locksmith.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.590
Sir?

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.000
Sir?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.240
- Why is it you?
- Master?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.080
(Best Lock)

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.920
Have a seat.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.120
Master, please sit.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.920
Master,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.280
I miss you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.840
deeply now.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.870
I miss you so much

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.910
that my tears fall like rain, Master!

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.840
Cut the drivel.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.680
You are a locksmith.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.870
This is true.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.360
The best lock.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.480
I hope I won't reincarnate

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.630
like Master.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.630
How shameful.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.640
Relax.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.140
Even if you reincarnate,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.320
I'll accompany you;

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.680
I won't let this happen.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.600
Here.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.120
Make a copy of this key.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.200
Can you do it?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.120
This...

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.970
You can't?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.870
Impossible.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.040
50 for a key.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.240
Plus the fees

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.800
for labor, delay,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.750
materials,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.390
lung-clearing syrup,

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.430
and medical services...

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.870
I'll give you a discount, Master.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.000
300 taels

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.750
in total.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.830
300 taels?

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.750
Master,

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.510
you still need
to pay your disciple, right?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.640
Master,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.680
if you're really broke,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.950
how about

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.190
teaching me the spell

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.600
of turning stone to gold tonight?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.070
Master, please teach me.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.190
Go away.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.110
Relax.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.350
The millennium jade marrow.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.780
It's not conjured by spells.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.600
Can you copy it or not?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.740
Can you copy it or not?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.560
Of course.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.920
Leave it to me.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.160
We'll go in right now?

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.230
Don't be afraid.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.840
I'm here.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.680
How long were we gone?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.070
Why has the city become like this?

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.940
With so much upheaval,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.640
Hunling City

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.830
couldn't escape disaster.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.240
Besides,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.950
this is
the Serpent Immortal's sanctuary;

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.390
desolation was inevitable.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.510
It's close by.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.360
The Dragon Ancestor is a founding deity.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.680
Even reborn,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.570
why would he be in a place like this?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.070
Something's there!

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.720
Look.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.680
There's another one.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.720
Stop scaring me!

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.040
You're an immortal,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.630
yet you fear these things?

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.500
My cultivation is lacking, okay?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.870
Find the Dragon Ancestor yourself;

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.710
I'm leaving.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.830
This place has been abandoned for years;

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.190
it doesn't look inhabited.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.480
Perhaps I guessed wrong.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.150
But...

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.800
Are you looking for me?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.750
Inside the well!

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.910
Who's there? Stop your ghost tricks!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.920
As long as the money's right,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.430
you can have
all the ghost tricks you want.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.310
You can believe me.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.360
Don't come closer!

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.270
Hong Baoyu?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.520
You are...

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.190
the Dragon Ancestor?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.920
You're...

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.630
returning it to me?

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.950
We had a deal.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.000
The chest of gold is non-refundable.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.720
Aren't you a locksmith?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.910
What are you doing here?

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.030
I am

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.600
Hong Baoyu,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.550
a jack of all trades.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.150
As you can see,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.080
I'm currently entrusted by the people;

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.390
now, I am

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.960
a demon-quelling

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.080
cultivator.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.870
A con artist.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.720
In this endless

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.960
and vast world,

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.720
I can ascend to the heavens

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.240
and descend to the abysses.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.870
I know everything in the world.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.480
My orders are effective.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.230
Master,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.240
if what you need is a locksmith,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.960
I can be that too.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.960
That works?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.870
Any more keys to copy?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.360
I'll give you a discount.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.080
Exorcist, locksmith,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.240
chef, bodyguard,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.510
doctor, juggler,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.350
and coroner.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.720
Old trades.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.120
Tailoring and coffin-making.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.440
I've got

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.510
every trade covered.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.270
He is

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.120
the Dragon Ancestor?

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.510
The Dragon Ancestor?

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.480
What does he do?

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.240
I can be that too.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.150
How much are you paying?

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.000
A con artist.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.390
Wait.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.200
What if he really is?

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.670
My master is our God of War.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200
Just in case.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.630
As long as the money's enough,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.630
and you keep me comfortable,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.270
I can do

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.000
anything.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.910
Is he an idiot?

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.120
It was glowing a moment ago;

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.600
now it's dark again.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.600
The Dragon Ancestor should make it work.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.670
Then why?

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.030
The Dragon Ancestor

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.120
was highly respected.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.670
He turned his merits

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.150
into the Sun Artifact

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.130
to shine upon the world.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.360
The only reason

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.960
the Artifact won't light

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.440
is that he

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:32.960
lacks virtue.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.550
A mercenary

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.870
and cruel man

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.390
has no virtue at all.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.280
Right.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.000
Then let's melt him with love.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.990
Love?

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.720
We'll seek the kindness inside him.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.320
Virtue needs nurturing.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.320
Where are you going?

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.000
To find him some love.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.200
Find love?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.910
No need.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.030
Tell me who to become,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.550
and I'll become them.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.910
Hong Baoyu's parents?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.970
You're helping Hong Zhua
look for his parents?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.600
I'm trying to melt him with love.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.960
Maybe he suffered some childhood trauma;

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.750
if we untie that knot,

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.720
we might fix the Sun Artifact.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.080
Go on.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.910
He was born with jade,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.320
so everyone thought him auspicious.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.360
But soon after,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.390
the city met disaster:

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.550
Sunlight dimmed,

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.480
his family's fields lay waste,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.440
and his parents

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.840
could barely stay alive.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840
With no choice,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.910
they abandoned him while fleeing.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.360
All these years,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.630
in such a ruined world,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.750
surviving as a lone orphan

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.440
is rough.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.560
(So, Hong Zhua is here.)

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.280
(The shard was born with him.)

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.150
(If I go meet him now,)

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.240
(I'll fight Jie Chuan for sure.)

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.320
(I should disguise myself
as Hong Zhua's father)

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.360
(and wake him up)

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.960
(to take back the shard.)

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.230
Thank you.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.120
- My pleasure.
- Thanks.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.680
Goodbye.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.870
(Now,)

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.840
(the soul inside Ji Li is complete;)

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.390
(Jin Li's body has appeared.)

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.630
(A perfect chance to exorcise.)

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.080
(Jie Chuan,)

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.590
(love truly clouds)

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.320
(the mind.)

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.440
(Since you're lost in love,)

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.480
(wait for the trap to close)

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.000
(and kill you.)

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.030
- Hurry up!
- Why?

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.240
I've got a surprise for you.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.020
What surprise?

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.670
- I've prepared it for ages.
- Why here?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.030
Hurry. Less chatter.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.550
I checked your background;

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.870
a kind neighbor
brought your father here.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.150
What do I need a father for?

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.110
My father?

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.150
What do I need a father for?

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.910
Don't you want to meet him

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.670
and ask why he abandoned you?

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.550
I don't.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.790
I sprang from a crack in the rocks;

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.270
I've got no father.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.510
This man

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.390
is the richest landlord,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.080
known by everyone.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.670
How famous?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.000
People call him

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.360
Hong Bancheng.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.200
Hong Bancheng...

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.320
Father,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.270
I'm here!

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.390
My jade?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.360
I gave it away.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.200
Gave it away? To whom?

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.080
To someone

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.600
I like.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.600
She's Ms. Jin.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.510
It's glowing!

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.150
Dragon Ancestor,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.000
looks like we did the right thing.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.080
The fated one with virtue.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.670
So, what is

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.910
our next step?

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.200
Let Ji Li

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.030
melt the fated one,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.550
and the Artifact will be restored.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.440
Ji Li,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.120
I never believed

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.320
in any fate.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.030
I only want us

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.200
to never part in this life.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.360
(Why does my chest ache so?)

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.150
(How annoying.)

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.100
(Hong Residence)

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.910
The spell turning stones to gold?

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.550
Ms. Jin taught you that?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.000
Aren't you living elsewhere?

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.280
What are you sneaking in for so late?

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.630
Before I inherit your fortune,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.790
I won't recognize you as my father.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.600
I heard today

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.080
that you gave that jade
to someone you love.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.030
As your father, I'm delighted.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.120
I'm getting old;

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.910
I'd like grandchildren around me soon.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.720
When will you bring her to meet me?

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.360
I can't.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.150
She's not mine to summon.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.790
Why should she come see you?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.700
You're my son.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.830
If you want something, fight for it,

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.830
or will you just hand it over?

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.110
In two days,

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.110
I'm holding a banquet
to acknowledge you as my heir.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.920
She is the go-between for us.

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.640
Use the occasion

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.160
to invite her here.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.030
I'll help you.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.680
(On the day of the banquet,)

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.950
(things will go back to normal.)

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.920
(All this folly will finally end.)

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.920
(Ji Li,)

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.000
(you're the best knife.)

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
(It's time to use you.)

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.280

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.240
