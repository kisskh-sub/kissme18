=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.262
=Episode 6=
(Encountering Zhong Kui)

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.440
You're really good-looking.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.800
Even more than him,

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.959
him,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.319
and him.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.460
All of you are good-looking.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.820
If you agree to be my wife,

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:05.480
I'll let you go.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.220
Otherwise,
when Zhong Kui catches ghosts tonight,

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:08.720
you'll all die.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.399
Scholar Zhong Nan
has hair standing on end.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.960
He wears green robe, belt,
and wide black boots.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.520
Big ghosts jump, while small ghosts cry.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240
Bloodied mouth
devours hearts and livers.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.390
Summoning ghosts is easy.
Getting rid of them is hard.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.600
Close the doors, stay safe.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.639
Stay safe.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.399
(This person seems hysterical.)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.320
Do you have something to tell me?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.000
Will you be my wife?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.320
Dear.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.080
That song you just sang was so creepy.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.559
We also worship Zhong Kui,

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:48.880
but why does he eat people?

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.039
Because this mountain is full of villains.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.279
Zhong Kui wants to eat them all up.

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.679
Stomach first,

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.440
then the skin,

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.919
and the bones.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.720
And

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:59.320
the head.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.919
Summoning ghosts is easy.
Getting rid of them is hard.

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.160
Getting rid of them is hard.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.279
Dear.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.199
You said

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.039
you wanted me to be your wife,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.800
but you haven't even told me your name.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.839
Me?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.520
My name is...

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.639
My name is Huang Baotian.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.160
I'm the king

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.600
here.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.839
Your dear.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.639
You said your surname is Huang.

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.679
Did your family run a funeral shop?

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.800
(Huang Family Shop)
In the back streets of the market.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.759
How do you know?

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.880
Before my brother and I
went up the mountain,

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.880
we ran a shop in the city.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.279
Baotian.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.679
Light the lanterns.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.679
Xuezhao Residence's

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.079
Divine Lady Thrush.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.200
You recognize me?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.600
I've seen you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.200
at Xuezhao Residence.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.959
You fool.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.839
You two, follow me.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.160
Please

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.279
resolve the ghost problem
on this mountain.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.640
You mean Zhong Kui summoning ghosts?

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:38.359
Since I'm here,

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.040
I can't just stand by.

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.239
I'm Divine Lady Thrush's...

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:48.560
This person is named Lu Yanchong.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.480
He's the new magistrate
of Huachang County.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.959
He's here to hunt bandits.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.190
I pretended to lead him up the mountain
to help you eliminate this major threat.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.720
If you don't want trouble,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.160
you'd better tie him up

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:00.000
and feed him to Zhong Kui.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:06.320
Sir.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.839
You're two-faced,
harbor treacherous intentions,

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.410
and have repeatedly plotted against me.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.559
You don't think

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:13.880
I'll just let it go, do you?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.875
(Midnight)

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:17.720
Summoning ghosts is easy.
Getting rid of them is hard.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.000
Lose the head, stay safe.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.160
Lead into the basin, expose it to sun.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:28.600
Share the same tides and humidity.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.079
As expected,

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:21.200
it's poisonous.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.690
This is the layout
of the mountain stronghold.

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.719
You're skilled.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.690
That's why you dared
to go up the mountain alone.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.320
You're not greedy for credit
or colluding with bandits as we thought.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.479
Even if I followed,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.440
I couldn't remember
such a complex stronghold layout

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:56.960
so clearly.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.760
Hurry down the mountain

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.440
and bring men to wipe out the bandits.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.760
There seems to be poison on the claws.

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:08.440
I have a bezoar pill.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.760
Please take it, Sir.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.180
You even changed the way you address me.

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:17.880
I misjudged you.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.440
Once we deal with these bandits,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.440
I'll apologize to you properly.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.700
(Officiated
By Huang Baocheng and Huang Baotian)

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:50.562
(Spirit Tablet of Huang Agen, Officiated
by Huang Baocheng and Huang Baotian)

00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:52.599
(Spirit Tablet of Huang Agen.)

00:09:52.599 --> 00:09:56.475
(Died in the Third Month
of the Jihai year)

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.280
The third Month of the Jihai year.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.719
(It's the same month
the Thrush Case occurred.)

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:04.320
Who?

00:10:14.412 --> 00:10:17.050
(Spirit Tablet of Huang Agen)

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.350
(Died in the Third Month
of the Jihai year)

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.719
(I'm really curious)

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.479
(what in this world could scare you.)

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:40.320
Sir.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:42.159
You don't think

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.320
I'll just let it go, do you?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.119
(Jiang Chun is Outside.)

00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:51.359
Speaking of which,

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.239
County Magistrate Jiang
is my subordinate.

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:56.559
Now,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.280
you two are getting more in sync.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.080
I almost wish
that County Magistrate Jiang

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.400
hadn't arrived in time yesterday,

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:05.640
so you would have died
under Zhong Kui's hands.

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:07.760
Do you hate me that much?

00:11:08.479 --> 00:11:09.679
I have a chronic illness.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.119
I need traditional acupuncture
every day at dusk.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.599
Yesterday you tied me up,

00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:14.919
making me miss the time.

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:17.080
I almost died in the countryside.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.760
I didn't know.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.880
Yes, you didn't know.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.480
If you really
had ill intentions toward me,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.760
I wouldn't be alive now.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.760
But I can't let my guard down

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.640
around you.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.760
You tied me out of the city.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.960
I used you to go up the mountain.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.080
We're even.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.559
After going down the mountain,

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.280
we'd better separate completely

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.200
and have nothing to do with each other.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.200
I just took a walk outside

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.880
and gathered some news.

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:48.760
It's said that

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.679
Huang Baotian dug up
several jars of wine

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:51.799
in the forest a few days ago.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.719
All the people who drank with him
that night ended up dead.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.520
And all of them lost heir heads.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.559
Huang Baotian went mad from then on.

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:00.559
Later,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.239
anyone left alone after midnight

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:05.000
would easily lose their head.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.520
Tell me.

00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:09.000
Who could this head-eating Zhong Kui be?

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:12.039
Huang Baotian.

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:18.359
I guess you have many questions for him,

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.400
so I deliberately captured him.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.159
Consider it

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.719
an apology for my rashness yesterday.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:45.612
(Died in the Third Month
of the Jihai year)

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.479
In the sixth month of the Jihai year,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.200
did you and your brother

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:52.080
bury a head

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.919
at Qili Slope outside Huachang County?

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:55.280
A head?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.719
Qili Slope.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.320
Yes, Qili Slope.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.400
Whose head was it?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.239
Father suddenly died.

00:13:06.239 --> 00:13:08.880
Baocheng cut off the head.

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:11.080
Head.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.799
Why did you put

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:14.080
Li Ji's seal on that head?

00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:19.280
Lead into the basin, expose it to sun.

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:22.479
Share the same tides and humidity.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:23.719
Someone paid money.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.280
A lot of money.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.960
Someone took the head.

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:30.000
He's too crazy.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.239
We can't get anything from him.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.200
To get solid evidence,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.440
you need to subdue
his superstitious older brother.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.799
Head.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.080
Head.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.520
Head.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.400
What did you do?

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:47.760
The fake evidence back then

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.960
must be connected to him.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.919
He's killed so many here.

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:54.559
Neither human nor ghost.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.479
He deserves some suffering.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.239
What's wrong?

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:03.479
Nothing.

00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:05.599
I'm just drained from the procedure.

00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:11.000
Help me.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.080
How?
