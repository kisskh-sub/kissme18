00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.870
Ms. Jin.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.310
Ms. Jin?

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.880
Why are you here?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.400
Ms. Jin,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.350
my father's throwing a banquet for us.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.790
I want to give him a gift.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.480
Could you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.510
help me pick one?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.600
I...

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.590
(No matter what fate says,)

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.680
(the Artifact must be mended.)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.790
(I might as well let Master)

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.790
(feel love soon.)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.840
All right.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.840
I'll come with you.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.790
Let's go.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.270
Shopkeeper!

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.680
Coming, coming.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.230
Wrap this hairpin for me.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.070
Sir,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.070
I'm terribly sorry.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.200
Just now, a patron

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.590
bought the entire shop.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.560
This pin

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.040
can't be sold to you.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.270
Who was it?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.760
Me.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.880
You're too late

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.480
for this hairpin;

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.520
it's mine.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.390
Weren't you choosing a gift
for your father?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.200
This one

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.310
will do nicely.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.910
I'm giving it to you.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.200
You're welcome.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.920
Later,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.960
I'll bring a girl here.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.910
You should

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.960
play robbers and scare her;

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.680
I'll swoop in and save her.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.630
Understood?

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.560
Yes, yes.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.780
Rescuing a damsel in distress.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.680
Take this.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.120
Wait.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.470
Nice try.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.150
Pulling this on me?

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.430
Everyone,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.590
throw him down!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.840
I just paid you in gold!

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.960
You saw it.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.160
Hey, there must be a mistake.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.080
Let me explain.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.000
Wait!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.280
Help! Help!

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.800
It glows even now?

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.710
No wonder Hong Baoyu
talked about surprise.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.750
What a surprise indeed.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.000
I didn't want you to go to him.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.190
I was on my way to find you.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.870
I just didn't want you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.120
alone with him, okay?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.680
Such a miser giving you gifts.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.960
He's up to something.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.800
I'm trying to restore the Artifact.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.720
True feelings

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.270
can fix the Artifact,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.400
but it never said

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.800
the feeling had to be love.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.360
There's also family and friendship.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.070
Since every feeling is fine,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.560
I can do it, too.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.870
Stop meddling.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.820
I'm only trying to mend

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.410
his bond with his father.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.800
He invited me

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.160
to his banquet tonight.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.070
His bond with his father?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600
I'll go for you.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.600
It's just about feeling, right?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.680
I'm brimming with warmth.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.240
I'll give it to him.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.680
What are you doing?

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.160
Hong Baoyu! Hong Baoyu!

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.270
Stay put.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.070
You're here. Don't speak yet.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.510
There are things I can't say

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.920
to your face,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.190
so let me say them like this,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.470
okay?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.830
Before I met you,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.830
I put money above everything;

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.480
I believed

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.480
money was the root of life.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.630
But since knowing you,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.430
I've learned

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.270
that some things

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.120
can't be measured with money.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.360
Every moment between us

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.830
is a treasure that no money could buy.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.950
Today,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.430
I want to tell you:

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.630
I like...

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.040
You?

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.560
So, you care about me so much.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.160
I was worried

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.870
about how to let you feel my friendship,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.070
but now I know

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.950
I worried for nothing.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.110
How about

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.320
we become sworn brothers?

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.910
You?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.960
What?

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.030
Let us

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.240
swear to heaven

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.520
and become brothers.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.910
Let us...

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.800
Raise your fingers.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.480
Heaven, listen:

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.510
Hong Baoyu and I

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.600
form a brotherhood today.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.320
We'll never abandon each other.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.460
Should we break this oath,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.050
let heaven strike us dead.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.600
Say it.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.190
Say it.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.130
Should we break this oath,
let heaven strike us dead.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.640
(Heaven,)

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.160
(pretend you didn't hear that,)

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.870
(or you'll regret it.)

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.920
Wait, you...

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.480
Who wants to be your sworn brother?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.840
Since it's ready,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.200
come and drink.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.630
Who wants to drink with you?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.960
Ji Li.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.350
Feng Tian.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.000
Come at me.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.030
Let her go!

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.430
She is my blade to kill you.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.710
Without her,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.270
how else can I kill you

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.070
and reclaim my place
as ruler of both realms?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.240
1,000 years ago,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.560
I sent Jin Li to infiltrate
the Demon Realm

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.070
for this very day.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.000
300 years ago,

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.430
I planted a fish bone in her

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.240
to trick you into nurturing it
with Demonic Ether.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.390
Now,

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.680
the hour is ripe:

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.480
Once Ji Li and Jin Li become one,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.870
Jie Chuan,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.600
you will not escape death.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.550
Let me go!

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.990
Ji Li.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.470
Ji Li,

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.440
you finished what Jin Li

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.630
left unfinished.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.080
When Jie Chuan dies,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.360
you'll have the first merit.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.200
Feng Tian,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.440
keep dreaming.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.360
Jie Chuan,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.840
your Demonic Ether

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.000
has crushed me for years.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.600
Now, the Artifact is shattered.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.360
Your Demonic Ether

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.440
has become a weapon
that could ruin the world.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.870
As expected,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.630
the chaotic Demon Realm

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.720
should be ruined forever.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.110
Ji Li!

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.750
I've waited for a thousand years

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.720
for this moment.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.960
Jie Chuan,

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.320
will you save her

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.440
or the whole world?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.080
Your death is already written;

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.440
only I

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.030
can rule both realms.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.240
Ji Li, I just didn't want you to worry.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.390
I never

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.320
believed in fate!

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.750
Stop!

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.390
- Master!
- Hong Zhua,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.630
do you also covet

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.960
the throne of both realms?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240
Your Grace,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.000
I once believed

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.670
immortals were orthodox,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.600
and demons were heresy.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.030
I longed for clear order

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.200
and everything

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.750
to work in turn.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.600
But these days in Hunling City,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.630
I've seen too much.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.320
The immortal-demon strife

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.060
threw the Three Realms into chaos,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.360
leaving the mortals in endless misery.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.630
Is this fate?

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.320
If such strife

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.960
is indeed our fate,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.750
then I will follow

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.670
my heart

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.000
and smash that fate.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.370
Impossible...

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.630
Only the Dragon Ancestor

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.720
can mend the Artifact.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.080
If you hand the shard to him,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.480
how long do you think you'll live?

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.200
Precisely because of that,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.840
salvation

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.390
or ruin

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.030
depends on Jie Chuan.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.360
The Dragon Ancestor reborn

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.870
is Jie Chuan, Demon Sovereign.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.720
Dragon Ancestor,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.150
I've regained my memory.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.550
Please tell me

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.150
the way to restore the Artifact.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.200
Whatever the cost,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.720
I will bear it

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.790
without complaint.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.750
The Artifact was forged

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.720
with my left eye 10,000 years ago.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.080
Now, it was broken

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.360
because of your dispute.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.670
To repair it,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.790
the reborn must willingly give up
both eyes.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.200
Hong Zhua,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.910
all phenomena

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.960
are but fleeting illusions.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.960
You think you are me in the world,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.960
yet you are not;

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.390
you think you cannot save the world,

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.670
yet perhaps you can.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.920
The choice

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.240
is yours alone.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:44.480
How can it be Jie Chuan?

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.080
Your Grace,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.840
only I know

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.270
where Jin Li's body dwells.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.870
If you insist on destroying
the Three Realms,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.710
then I

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.150
must defy your order.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.150
Everything I've done

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.600
was to unite the realms

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.030
and bring eternal peace.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.630
Now, fate has chosen another?

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:06.630
Impossible.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.110
Jie Chuan,

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.150
you claim you seek peace
between immortals and demons.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.320
This is the perfect moment.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.080
Offer your eyes and save the world.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.910
Once you lose your sight,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.870
let's see how many days you survive.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.790
Why should I risk the wrath of heaven

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.790
to kill a benefactor

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.240
who'll soon be blind?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.240
So what

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.270
if I lose

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.480
a pair of eyes?

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.200
No.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.350
Wait.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.600
There has to be another way.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.480
You once said

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.960
Hunling City

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.270
is vivid and alive,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.170
and it's your favorite place.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.630
How could you bear

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.270
to watch it get ruined?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.320
I will stay with you

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.510
as a mortal.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.320
You think of the Three Realms;

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.720
I am selfish.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.670
I will stay with you

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.080
for the rest of my life.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.680
Your Grace,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.840
I will restore

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.630
the Sun Artifact;

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.750
I beg you

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.270
to honor your word

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.190
and return to your place.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.590
Ji Li.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.550
Ji Li, are you there?

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.390
Where are you?

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.710
Ji Li?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.550
Ji Li, where are you?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.270
Come and find me.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.390
Come and find me.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.560
Ji Li.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.040
Ji Li.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.960
Ji Li.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.920
Ji Li.

Yes.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.640
