00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.079
Outdoor livestream

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.920
You...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.399
You didn't use your position for personal gain, did you?

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.719
This report

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.880
passed the audit of every department in the company,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.600
including

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.159
a 106-page feasibility report,

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.759
79 pages of data analysis,

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:54.320
and 38 pages of ROI analysis.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.960
I didn't use my position for personal gain.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.119
I also hope you

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640
can handle matters impartially.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.079
Thank you, President Wen.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.079
Monitor this livestream closely.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.719
Mobilize all available resources.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.239
I suspect

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.200
someone is maliciously manipulating data

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.879
to lower our ranking.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.760
Don't worry.

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:30.439
I'll handle it.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.439
Thank you to all the Little Stars for your support.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.599
Saturday night at 8:00,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.560
we will bring you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.760
even more perks and discounts.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.480
Please tune in then.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.599
See you next time!

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
Good work, good work.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.599
Drink some water.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.239
Good job, have some water.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.319
Oh my god.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.040
Let me tell you,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.840
the results of this livestream were off the charts!

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.560
Do you know?

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.480
In just three hours of streaming,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.159
the total GMV has already broken 10 million!

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Broken 10 million?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.760
Yes!

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.680
You didn't expect that, did you?

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.400
I'm going to quickly prepare

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.920
the product selection for your next stream.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.879
They're all bestsellers.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.080
See you tonight.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.400
Go, go, go.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.759
Bye-bye.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.039
Good work, everyone.

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.479
Ms. Qi Xing, thank you for your hard work.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.080
Um,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.000
since this livestream event

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.159
is quite far from the city,

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.479
you'll have to rough it a bit tonight

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.080
and stay overnight in a tent here at the camp.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.840
It's fine, I can handle it.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.240
Actually, I've been following you for a long time.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.360
Ever since that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.879
Amazon Rainforest livestream.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.520
Thank you.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.280
Get some rest,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.960
Ms. Qi Xing.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.759
Didn't you say you couldn't be bothered?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.960
Why are you suddenly going?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
This project is quite important to the company,

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.400
so I want to go see it for myself.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.400
Is it really just to see the project?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
Just drive.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.840
Talk less.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.039
President Wen?

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.120
What brings you here?

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.960
You know who I am?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.280
I didn't recognize you before.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.719
I only realized after reading Sihai's internal journal

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.240
that I had already met the legend.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.479
That day at the art exhibition,

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.879
I spouted some nonsense.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.159
Please don't take it to heart.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.599
I'm not that petty.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.800
You know,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.080
in my position,

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:29.840
it's hard to hear the truth.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.439
That's true.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.879
I understand.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.840
Don't worry.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.039
I am someone

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.199
who is very tight-lipped.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.599
I will definitely keep your secret.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.800
He...

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.719
He is my...

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:43.240
Op-

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.719
po-

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.599
site-

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:45.280
sex

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.759
bestie.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.479
Get it?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.800
As Sihai Group's closest partner,

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:52.439
I trust you.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.479
Definitely.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.879
I trust you.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.400
Yeah, right.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.960
President Wen,

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.319
what brings you here?

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.479
As your boss,

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.280
I have to come inspect the work, of course.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.800
The fact that President Wen came

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.400
shows how much importance he attaches

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.439
to the cooperation between Sihai and Lin's Group.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.240
So, are you two now...

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.680
I was blind before.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.439
I didn't know your

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.800
"good friend" was actually the young Mr. Wen of Sihai Group.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:24.399
How were the results of today's livestream?

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:26.600
The results were excellent.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.279
In three hours, the total GMV

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.680
has already broken 10 million.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.600
And the ROI is already 14.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:35.879
There's still room for growth.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.439
Is there another broadcast tomorrow morning?

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.199
Yes.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.439
Tomorrow, we plan to

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.120
start streaming from the early morning

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.560
and continue until the sun rises.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.240
The theme is called

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.040
"Watching the Sunrise

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.680
with You."

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.759
Watching the sunrise?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.319
Good.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:53.040
Then we'll stay the night.

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.879
Tomorrow, we'll all

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.439
watch the sunrise together.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.800
That's great!

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.000
There is one problem.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.519
We don't have enough tents.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:03.399
Then...

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.000
Ou Lu can share a tent with Qixing.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.120
You...

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.319
who will you share a tent with?

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.519
I can stay with President Lin.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.199
Being able to stay with President Wen

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.399
That... that's my honor.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.600
Today, I will not

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.800
give you a chance to get close to Xin Tong.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.040
This

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.120
is our campsite for today.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.879
Beautiful, right?

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.519
Hello.

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.959
Ou Lu.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.720
Say hello.

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:36.600
Hello.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.519
Hello.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.279
Of course,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.399
we can't forget

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:43.399
our little camping barbecue.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.959
And our two handsome boss presidents.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.240
Hello.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.879
Of course,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.040
and also

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:53.160
myself.

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:54.800
Xin Tong,

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:10.439
it's not quite done yet.

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:12.480
Let me grill President Wen a bit more...

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.360
I'll grill it a little longer.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.759
Are there any other skewers ready?

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.600
Here.

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:23.000
What are you grilling?

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.720
So spicy!

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.680
Xin Tong,

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.879
have some water.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.920
Wen Pei'an,

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.040
I'm going to rest for a bit.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.519
I'll take over.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.560
Today, I'll make you look bad in front of Xin Tong.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.000
Let me do the grilling for a while.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:14.360
Have some water.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:17.519
Thank you, President Wen.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:17.879
Drink up.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.560
How did this happen?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.319
Probably got shaken up too much during the move.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.240
Are you okay?

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.240
Here's some tissue.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.560
I'll do it.

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:44.600
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.879
I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:07.959
No,

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:08.480
it's fine.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.079
It's fine, President Wen.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:09.639
Then you...

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:09.959
It's fine.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:10.199
I'll change.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:10.680
Change.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.720
I'll go change.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.720
Boss,

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.399
how do we light the charcoal without fire?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.399
Sneaking around,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.679
up to no good.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.000
Our distance

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.480
is only one centimeter.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.440
Wen...

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.159
Young Master Wen.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:39.679
Wh...

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:40.320
What is it?

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.399
Looking for a lighter.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:09.600
I'll be right there.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:11.720
Otherwise,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.519
you two rest for a bit.

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:15.720
My live stream is about to start.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.720
I'm heading out now.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:19.799
I'm fine here now.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.919
You go help her.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.840
Okay.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.200
I think

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.679
there's something I must tell you.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.120
Hold on, President Wen.

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:36.480
I also have something to say.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.320
How about you listen to me first,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.679
then decide if you still want to speak.

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.080
Go ahead.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.559
I...

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:49.919
I think we're probably not the same kind of people.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.759
Of course we're not the same kind of people.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.039
I respect everyone's choices.

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.000
But, well...

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.000
But

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.320
what exactly are you trying to say?

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:03.000
You can see it.

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:04.759
The one I like is Xin Tong.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.759
I like her too.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:10.519
You...

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.879
You like Xin Tong?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:14.919
That's right.

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:21.879
Not President Wen.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.279
My...

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.759
My liking for Xin Tong is...

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.720
It's not love.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.879
It's just...

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.600
that kind of pure friendship between a man and a woman.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.519
Do you understand?

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.759
Therefore,

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:33.879
I hope this won't affect

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:35.120
the relationship between us.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.639
To say something like that without batting an eye,

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:40.600
you're really not an ordinary person.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.840
If you genuinely like her,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.240
I would bless you both.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.879
But your character...

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:52.759
You should know better than I do.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.399
So I advise you to watch your step.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:56.960
If I find out

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.960
you have any ulterior motives,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.519
I will break my own principle

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.960
and stop being someone who separates public and private matters.

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:08.360
President Wen,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.919
between Xin Tong and me,

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.399
it's just pure friendship between a man and a woman.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.159
Please don't overthink it.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.759
I hope I'm overthinking it.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:54.600
Still up this late?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.440
Ms. Qi Xing.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.000
Enjoying the night.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.519
I like the night too.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.159
It's as if only in the deep night

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:07.919
is the time that truly belongs to oneself.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.000
I often watch your livestreams at night.

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:14.759
When I was at my lowest,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.840
your streams gave me strength.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.200
So I don't just admire your talent,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.639
I'm also drawn to your charm.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.799
In other words,

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:26.759
you're my ideal type.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.919
Then what is Xin Tong to you?

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.399
Xin Tong and I are just

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:39.080
good friends.

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:40.320
We're not lovers.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.759
But she doesn't seem to think so.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.480
I'm also afraid of hurting her.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.600
So I need some time to explain it to her.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.840
That's actually quite decent of you.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:57.039
I believe people should treat each other with

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.000
the utmost goodwill.

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:00.679
To be honest,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.039
this livestream by our Lin's Group

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:06.440
was tailor-made for you, Ms. Qi Xing.

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:07.960
With no regard for return on investment.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.159
Thank you.

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:14.039
And I think

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.679
Sihai Group

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.440
should let a more capable person

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.519
become its successor.

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:22.720
But why are you so familiar

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.519
with my family affairs?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.159
Let me make

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:28.720
an inappropriate assumption.

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:32.600
If you and I were to marry,

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:35.840
then Sihai and Lin's Group

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.240
would become Jiangcheng's largest commercial entity.

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.679
I would spare no effort

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.360
to push you onto Sihai's successor throne.

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.080
Even to the point of becoming

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.320
the Wen family's live-in son-in-law.

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:50.559
I didn't realize you were so ambitious.

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:52.480
But I like it.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.879
I think you and I are the same kind of people.

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.639
Outwardly appearing gentle,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.960
but inside,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.320
a blazing fire burns.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.639
To achieve our goals,

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:05.480
we'll use any means necessary.

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:07.440
Others think we're

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.720
docile little house cats,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.919
but we're actually lions on the savannah.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.320
Aiming to establish a new order on the plains.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.320
Pleasure doing business.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.120
Pleasure doing business.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.600
Someone's fallen in the water!

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.840
Xin Tong!

00:14:50.919 --> 00:14:51.960
Thank you, President Wen.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.600
Here.
