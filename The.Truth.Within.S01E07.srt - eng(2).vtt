WEBVTT

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.820
Su, call an ambulance.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.940
Yes, sir.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.980
Mr. Qi.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.130
Here.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.580
Mr. Han, no one here.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.850
How is she?

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.170
Gotta detox her now.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.610
Xiaoxi,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.340
check on the ambulance.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.220
I'll go check there.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.050
Okay.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.250
Mom.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.700
Take a rest.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.490
Thank you.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.020
It's fine.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.700
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.930
Dad, Mom.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.170
Don't cry, babe.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.370
Alright. Let her rest.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.780
It's all over now.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.580
Right ahead.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.820
I'm just different from others.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.820
Does that make me a freak?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.890
Why would they bully me?

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.610
They're all jerks.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.770
I'll always protect you.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.940
Will you?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.010
Yeah.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.490
You were never a freak!

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.180
Never...

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.650
Back when Li Yiqi was

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.250
facing off with you on the rooftop,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.060
did he kinda react to the light?

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.530
React to the light?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.340
What are you even guessing at here?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.700
Before Fei died,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.100
she had the same reaction in the car!

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.340
Stop bringing up Fei!

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.650
Can we just drop it?

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.940
I solved the Raw Diamond case in person!

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.730
The killer died on the spot!

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.060
Li Ming's dead too!

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.250
Every drug dealer connected to

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:44.890
that case

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.180
got locked up or shot!

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.650
Snap out of it, Qi Sizhe!

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.100
This is over!

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.460
You're the irrational one!

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.340
Just get over it, okay?

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:52.820
Fine!

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.940
I've said whatever I could.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.060
Believe it or not!

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.580
Just stop it!

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.370
It's totally up to you!

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.250
You were adopted,

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.460
but Fei had always

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.940
treated you as her own brother!

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.100
I don't care what you'll do!

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.250
I don't care if you'll

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.130
investigate it!

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.460
I will find out the truth for Fei anyway!

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.340
It's over, all over!

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.220
I cracked that case!

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.940
That's over!

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.940
Get over it!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.100
Wake up!

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.940
It's done and dusted!

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.850
It's over.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.220
Mr. Qi.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.060
Did you finish Li Shuting's blood test?

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.210
Not Raw Diamond you're looking for?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.610
Come in.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.700
Mr. Bai.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.100
All the reports of Li Shuting's case

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.860
are here.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.420
Thank you.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.130
How are Qi Sizhe and Han Feng doing?

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.420
They can talk just fine at work,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.540
but I can still feel there's

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.290
a bit of a wall between them,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.690
probably because of

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.650
what went down before.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.970
Give them time.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.380
I'm leaving then.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:52.900
Okay.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.700
Mr. Qi.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.490
Have you sorted out all the evidence
in Li Shuting's case?

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.220
Yeah.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.180
I'm gonna file it.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.250
Are these

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.890
all the medicines seized from her home?

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.700
Yeah, some over-the-counter meds.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.580
Here are more. Look.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.730
I need to re-test them.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.650
Mr. Qi, what are you trying to test?

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.010
Nothing much.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.370
Just gotta confirm something.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.180
Mr. Qi,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.820
Li Shuting's drug test report is out.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.100
She'd been taking anti-bipolar meds.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.700
Apart from quetiapine fumarate,

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.180
nothing else special in her system.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.130
You looking for something?

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.580
I'm wondering

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.220
if her hallucinations were

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.940
caused by the drugs.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.700
But anti-bipolar drugs

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.300
shouldn't cause hallucinations.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.460
Gao Yuan.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.980
You ever seen this logo?

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.060
No.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.460
Thank you.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.300
It's fine.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.340
Ms. Liu.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.010
Here's your mom's death certificate.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:45.460
Autopsy...

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.180
Autopsy!

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.490
Miss...

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.220
I request an autopsy!

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.010
Please calm down...

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.980
She didn't die of illness!

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.820
I'm sure of it!

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:51.700
Ms. Liu, please...

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.890
I demand an autopsy!

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.610
Please calm down...

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.860
Well.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.570
Got anything from that drug?

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.460
No, the result's not out yet.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.180
Why?

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.660
You're gonna look into it?

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.490
Li Shuting and Li Yiqi were

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.090
really in similar states

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.330
of hallucination.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:36.090
Yes.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.980
As long as we can prove

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.330
that there are the same

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.940
drug components in their bodies,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.250
we can prove

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.980
the existence of a new type of drug.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.700
Even so,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.290
these two cases

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.140
can't be compared with

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.810
the Raw Diamond case.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.010
Han Feng...

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.090
I know you've been stuck in this

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.460
and can't let go of Fei's death!

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.660
But if she knew

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.140
her death's holding you back,

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.180
she wouldn't...

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.490
She wouldn't be happy.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.420
Han Feng.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.290
That can't be what really happened to Fei.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.620
I only trust what I saw with my own eyes!

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.730
Even if there's just a tiny bit of hope,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.420
even if it's a one-in-a-thousand chance,

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.180
I won't give up.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.380
The victims showed
no signs of common poisons,

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.860
but they all reacted to light.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.570
Light attraction...

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.290
Don't you move!

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.730
- I surrender!
- Well?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:34.860
Stop it!

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.330
Say it again.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.900
I surrender, okay?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.180
I got injured! It hurts!

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.010
What's wrong? It didn't kill you, huh?

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.530
Come on. You're gonna die before that.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.530
Seems you're fine.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.620
Congrats on your promotion, Captain Guan.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.330
Oh, Captain Han.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.460
Thank you for leaving,
so I got the chance, huh?

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.180
You're welcome, Captain Guan.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.220
Alright. Stop it.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.010
I got this.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.460
You're a guest here.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.140
I gotta take care of you.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.660
- Come on.
- No need for that.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.380
I'll just be straight.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.140
I'm here 'cause I wanna
ask you about Raw Diamond.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.700
Raw Diamond?

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.730
Your colleague, Ms. Zhu, called me before.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.810
Also for Raw Diamond. Don't you know?

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.380
So you're thinking

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.460
we never cracked that case back then?

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.730
But that's impossible.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.250
It's Qi Sizhe.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:33.900
Right?

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.770
He's now working with you.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.980
Is it because of him?

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.460
Kind of.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.420
Qi Sizhe speculated

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.090
that someone's working on new drugs

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.460
based on Raw Diamond

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.250
or conducting

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.770
secret experiments

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.460
on a specific group.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.010
And these victims showed

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.570
the same phototactic reaction
as Fei did before she died.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.900
If so,

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.010
it'll be a disaster.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.090
We'll support you anytime if needed.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.770
The whole anti-drug squad's got your back.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.570
Hey, I just thought of something.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.290
We used to think

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.980
Qi Sizhe was nuts, huh?

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.620
Liu Yuanyuan...

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.330
She thinks her mom was murdered,

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.250
right?

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.730
Got it. Bye.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.860
Zhu.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.660
We've got a missing person case

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.490
to look into.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.420
How come they gave us
a missing person case?

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.250
The missing person is Liu Yuanyuan.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.090
Her mother just
passed away due to illness,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.380
but she insisted

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.570
that her mother was killed.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.940
So they suspect something's off

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.900
about her disappearance.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.010
I've sent you the details

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.010
in your work email.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:06.810
Okay.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.010
How did you two find out

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.380
that Liu Yuanyuan was missing?

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:12.980
Yuanyuan worked really hard

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.460
and was never late or absent.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.140
She'd been living frugally

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.940
as her family wasn't well-off,

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.530
and she had to look after her sick mom.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.220
So Qing and I always brought her

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.290
some snacks or fruits

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.620
when we bought stuff.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.980
But since that day,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.380
I haven't seen her again.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.420
Yuanyuan,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.660
don't be too sad.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.220
Your mom wouldn't wanna see you like this.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:36.980
Rou,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.050
my mom was killed.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.010
She was murdered!

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.180
I know who did it.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.220
I'm gonna avenge my mom.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.660
I'm gonna get revenge.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.090
At first, I thought

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.810
Yuanyuan was just overly sad.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.490
Then I couldn't reach her four days ago.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.940
I went to her place,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.980
but she wasn't there

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.380
and her phone was off.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.290
I got a bit worried and called the cops.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.490
She said someone killed her mom?

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.860
Didn't she say who?

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.330
No.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.620
She seemed so heart-broken at that time,

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.220
so I thought she was just talking nonsense

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.220
and didn't believe it.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.730
From what you know,

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.700
what kind of person is Liu Yuanyuan?

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.660
She's pretty normal.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.730
She seems like a really innocent
and well-behaved girl.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.380
The customers are
quite satisfied with her.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.860
She also works really hard.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.420
But...

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.620
It's a bit of a pity.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.180
She said

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.980
her grades were great in high school

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.140
and she was gonna
go to a medical university.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.730
Then it seems something happened

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.290
and she had to take care of
her seriously ill mother.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:48.770
Now she's almost 30,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.770
not married

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.050
and even no boyfriend.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.900
So do you know

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.490
if she has other relatives

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.810
besides her mother?

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.660
It seems she only had her mom,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.980
so she was so sad
when her mom passed away.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.660
Then is Liu Yuanyuan's

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.010
social circle complicated apart from work?

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.620
She barely socializes.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.290
We're pretty busy with work.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.090
She's only

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.770
close to me and Qing.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.140
And I've never seen her

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.810
hanging out with anyone else.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.900
Before Liu Yuanyuan went missing,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.530
did you notice anything unusual about her?

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.050
Oh, yeah!

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.330
After her mom passed away…

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:24.980
A few days ago,

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.380
I saw her using her phone
to search for that thing

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.250
often used in mystery novels

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.620
to knock people out…

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.290
Ether.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.180
Yeah!

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:33.900
That's it!

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.730
But I didn't think much
about it at the time.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.860
Now that you're asking me,
it just occurred to me.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.180
Was she really preparing for a murder?

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.490
Oh, stop it.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.380
It's fine. It's nothing.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.010
Then let's...

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.140
Let's just end here.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.220
We'll call you if we need you.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:51.180
By the way,

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.490
what we talked about today stays

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.530
between us.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.770
They handed

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.860
this case to us

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.940
'cause they checked around

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.570
Liu Yuanyuan's neighborhood

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.980
and found out she bought a knife

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.050
before she went missing.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.490
Ether and a knife...

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.220
What on earth was she up to?

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.730
I'm really puzzled too.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.700
Haven't seen her for days.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.660
Her rent is due.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.460
So, does she usually

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.860
hang out with anyone?

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.490
She hardly goes out.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.620
Just heads home after work,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.330
and she'd say hi
when we ran into each other.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:48.810
Wan!

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.010
Xiaoxi looked up
Liu Yuanyuan's phone records,

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.620
and the last power-on was 4 days ago.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.810
I told her to check

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.660
the most recent call logs.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.090
Before she went missing,

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.860
she called another waitress just to

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.250
ask for covering her shift that afternoon.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.140
Seems she didn't
plan to disappear for good.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.570
She meant to come back after
finishing whatever she had to do.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.620
So why did she

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.660
buy a knife and search for ether?

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.700
Must've been planning to
use it on someone else.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:16.570
Someone else?

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.570
Who?

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.180
We gotta check
the surveillance around here,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.490
see where she went

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.810
after leaving here four days ago.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.460
But this area's pretty rundown,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.010
doubt there are any cameras around.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.460
I'll check if she took a cab.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.660
Just checked her home.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.010
Liu Yuanyuan's usually thrifty,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.220
unlikely she'd take a taxi.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:36.860
Then...

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.460
I'll call Xiaoxi again

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.050
and have her

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.380
pull footage from nearby bus stops.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.010
Okay.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.330
Also, notify the forensics team

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.570
to collect her fingerprints

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.220
and DNA samples

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.090
from her home.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.940
Bring back anything she's used before.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:49.620
Alright.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.460
You call forensics

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.180
and get them here.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.140
Sure.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.810
How is there?

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:04.620
Nothing wrong.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.330
Get off work then.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.250
Come on. The lighter.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.700
Who's there?

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.420
What's wrong?

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.180
Someone just passed by.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.660
How come?

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.620
It's been late.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:17.980
I did see it.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.420
You must've seen it wrong.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.250
Let's check it out.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.810
Hey! Right there!

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.180
Just a dog chewing on bones.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.250
A dog?

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.900
Who threw bones here?

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.530
Be careful.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.620
Wait, this looks like

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.810
human bones!

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.140
Come on! Get up!

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.900
Help me up!

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:46.980
Call the cops!

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.570
Come on! Call the police!

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.570
We were just on patrol

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.420
when we stumbled upon
a bag of bones over there.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.420
Looked like human bones.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.330
Human bones?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:19.530
You sure?

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:20.770
Not sure.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.860
Mr. Han.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:29.730
What did you see?

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.180
I think I spotted someone in the woods.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.490
Man or woman?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.730
Catch any details?

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.220
Not really.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.250
It vanished in a flash.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.770
Might be a woman.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.380
Might?

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.570
Go on.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.180
What do you say?

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.700
Female.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.490
Based on the pubic symphysis,

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.940
the surface is rough and blurry with

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.090
a noticeable dip in the middle,

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.010
and the nodules are totally gone,

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.420
edges still spreading.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.490
Plain English, please.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:13.380
Female.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.490
Over 45 years old.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:16.490
Bore kids before.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:17.570
The pelvis is intact,

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.660
no natural decay.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.090
Doesn't look like an old corpse.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.010
Plus, this powder

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.090
smells pungent,

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.380
like sulfuric acid.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.050
Gotta run lab tests

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.380
to know what's really in it though.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.940
What about Ms. Zhu and Wan?

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.940
They got a missing person case

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.290
and went looking into it.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.900
A missing person?

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.010
Don't know the details.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.290
Mr. Qi.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.810
The lab results on
that mystery powder are in.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.730
Phenolic resin?

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.930
You sure about that?

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:06.450
Yeah, seems weird to me too.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.090
Could you run the test again?

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.170
Sure.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.130
Hey.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.260
Are the ID comparison results back yet?

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:36.020
Can't extract

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.940
any DNA.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.380
What do you mean?

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.130
We need more leads

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.940
to move forward on this.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.130
Also,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.700
the yellow powder on the bones
is phenolic resin.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.220
It's an industrial material,

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.180
biggest feature is heat resistance,

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.620
like the stuff used to
bond abrasive grains

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.940
to grinding wheels.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.250
A grinding wheel for cutting the body?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.810
Still can't confirm that.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.530
You should also

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.860
keep an eye out for

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.330
any related clues at the scene.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.290
Did the drug tests for Li Yiqi

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.700
and Li Shuting come back?

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.380
Same new type of drug?

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.050
Results aren't in yet.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.460
I'll let you know

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.570
when they are.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.490
Got it.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.620
Mr. Han!

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.940
No other bones found.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.140
Expand the search area.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.290
Yes, sir.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.490
Searched all night

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.490
but got nothing.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.490
That security guard said
a dog gnawed on it,

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.010
but the bones don't

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:43.900
look chewed to me.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.530
Should be a murder
with the body chopped up,

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.810
then dissolved with acid or something
to get rid of the flesh,

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.860
and dumped in the wild.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.860
Likely just random dumping
after dismemberment.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.570
Murder and dismemberment?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.420
Ms. Zhu,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.140
last night we got a report about

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.860
some human bones found near a factory.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.050
My guess is

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.330
the flesh was dissolved
with acid or something,

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.490
the remains were left there.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.620
Mr. Qi thinks

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.810
the pelvis belongs to

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.660
someone over 40.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.490
Found anything on your end?

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.770
We're looking into

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.460
this missing young woman,

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.530
but so far we've got no leads.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.900
But all signs point to

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.220
this young girl

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.290
being a suspect in a murder.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.220
So Wan, are you saying

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.460
the killer might

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.010
be the girl

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.220
you're looking for?

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.180
Su, I didn't say that.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:43.220
Su.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.700
You've been a detective
for a few years, right?

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.770
We detectives gotta base our words

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.050
and actions on evidence.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.460
Be more careful with your words,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.220
got it?

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:52.250
Okay, Wan.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.330
But,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.010
there's still a chance, yeah.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.490
Hey!

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.090
You kidding me?

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.530
Mr. Han.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.730
We're working on these
two cases simultaneously.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.010
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu!

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.220
I've got new findings!

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.050
I found Liu Yuanyuan bought oxalic acid

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.210
and hydrochloric acid.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.370
Let me tell you about

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.290
the bones we found.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.860
For now, we can confirm

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.820
it's a female pelvis.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.210
The woman was probably

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.940
between 46 and 49 years old,

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.260
had given birth.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.300
The pelvis is intact,

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.380
no signs of natural erosion.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.170
Doesn't seem to be an old corpse.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.460
The weirdest thing is

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.530
we can't get any

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.010
valid DNA samples

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.090
from this pelvis.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.460
We found this yellow powder

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.460
on the surface of the bones.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.300
After testing, it's confirmed
to be phenolic resin.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:50.050
Although phenolic resin
is a bit corrosive,

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.090
normally it should only

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.050
corrode the surface of the bones,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.050
not completely destroy

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.010
the DNA structure.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.690
So,

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.570
the reason why we can't

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.340
get DNA samples

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.090
is still under

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.650
further investigation.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.940
Okay, then I'm gonna share with you

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.420
the info we've got here.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.050
First off, we've received
a missing person case.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.650
The missing person is Liu Yuanyuan.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.650
She left home four days ago

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.980
and never showed up.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.060
Before she went missing,

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.380
her colleague saw her

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.300
searching for ether on her phone.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.980
That thing often used

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.210
to knock people out in the novels...

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:29.740
Ether.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.090
Yeah! That's it!

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.570
And we found out

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.980
her mother passed away
from illness not long ago.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.010
According to the hospital
admission records,

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.610
her mother died suddenly

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.460
due to a sudden onset of

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.340
heart valve disease

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.210
and had a long-standing history
of heart problems.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.900
But Liu Yuanyuan insists

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.300
that her mother was murdered

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.650
and asked for a second autopsy.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.340
After the second autopsy,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.420
the forensic gave

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.940
the same conclusion as the first one.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.010
But Liu Yuanyuan still insists

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.900
that her mother was killed,

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.210
and she even claims

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.010
that she knows who the killer is.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.090
That's roughly the situation.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.490
This is the camera footage from
the supermarket near her home.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.530
She bought bleach, gloves,
black plastic bags,

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.980
and a knife

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.300
at the supermarket

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.210
near her home.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.340
Why did she buy these things?

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:19.740
I heard from the clerk

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.780
that she said she was gonna
clean the tea table.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.780
Wan and I went to Liu Yuanyuan's home.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.460
There were no signs of cleaning

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.050
anywhere in her house.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.090
Anything else?

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.610
This is the surveillance footage

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.050
from a hardware store near her workplace.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.690
Liu Yuanyuan bought a hemp rope,

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.010
as well as oxalic acid

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.860
and hydrochloric acid here.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.420
Mr. Qi, these acids are...?

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.130
Powerful solvents?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:42.860
Yeah.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:47.610
So she bought these things to kill someone

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.460
and then dissolve the body.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.980
Liu Yuanyuan suspects
someone killed her mom,

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.740
so your guess is possible.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.740
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu, someone just reported

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.940
finding new bones.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.130
Got it.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.980
Alright.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.300
You tell them about it.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.340
What did you find?

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.380
Mr. Qi.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:18.900
These are the evidences we found.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.170
There's a pile of ashes here.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.530
This looks like human bones. Look.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.980
Put this away.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:40.900
Got anything?

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.300
This time it's hands and feet.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.500
I'm gonna confirm

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.650
if it's the same victim

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:51.620
as the last accident.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.610
Did you see the person

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.900
who dumped the bones?

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.050
Who set the fire?

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.130
Okay, it's out.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.300
What's this?

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.780
Bones?

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.130
Seems to be a hand...

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.420
A human hand!

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:31.980
Who?

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:33.570
Who!

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.490
Did you see what that person looked like?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.820
That person was

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.610
wearing a hat.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.980
Height...

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.090
Probably about the same as mine.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.050
Could you tell if it was a man or a woman?

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.610
Can't tell.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.380
But the person was very thin.
Not likely a man.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.460
Do you think it's this person?

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.650
It was really dark then.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.340
Didn't really see clearly.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.340
Alright.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.090
Make a statement.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.460
Send them back to school.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.050
Okay.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.740
Come with me.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.210
You date here at midnight?

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:15.780
What's your major?

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:18.050
Mr. Han.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.090
They didn't see the face clearly

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.570
and couldn't confirm
if it was Liu Yuanyuan.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:30.650
Mr. Han.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.690
Quite similar to what
Liu Yuanyuan was wearing.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.050
Take it back for testing.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.650
Evidence bag.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.650
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu! New findings!

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.690
Human bones are found
in three different places!

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:59.130
Let's go check it out.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.010
Alright.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.940
Come on, hurry up.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:17.130
What's up?

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.740
There... There are bones!

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.380
Human sternums and ribs
were found at the landfill,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.340
with yellow powder on them.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.090
The pelvis was found the night before last

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.900
when the security guard was patrolling.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.010
Parts from the humerus to the phalanges

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.490
were found in the woods.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.740
The femur and tibia were
found in a suburban lake.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.420
Leg bones were found in the sewer
on Weimingfang Road,

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.420
also with yellow
phenolic resin powder on them.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.380
It seems

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.900
these aren't the bones of one person,

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.530
but of multiple victims.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.300
The results of the drug component

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.050
comparison in Li Yiqi
and Li Shuting's bodies are out.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.260
Mr. Wu, is it possible that
the drug formula Li Ming made

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.570
got leaked?

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:23.490
Did it?

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.940
These bones are from
multiple victims, right?

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.610
They're at least from ten people.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.010
Liu Yuanyuan disappeared

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.820
from the surveillance
at the end of an alley,

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.340
and there's a night market behind it.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.460
Is there a chance

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.490
that Liu Yuanyuan never
left the night market?

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.420
These bones

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.220
might not even be the victims'.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:38.930
His goal is

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.340
to make us clueless about

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.820
where these bones came from.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.900
The DNA of

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.010
missing persons and body parts...

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.500
We haven't compared it

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:47.100
for one person yet.
