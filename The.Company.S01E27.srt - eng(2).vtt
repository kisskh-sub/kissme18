=The Company=
=Season 1=

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 27=

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.400
Enjoy.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.879
Please enjoy your tea.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.599
Excellent tea.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.680
I see you know a thing or two
about tea as well, Miss Ye.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.519
I only know a little.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.840
You're far too modest.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.800
By the way, Master Dong,

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.879
I've heard

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.120
you have a gallery

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.400
with quite a collection.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.759
Could I see it?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.520
I didn't think you'd know

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.000
about my little private gallery.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.639
Of course, you can.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.560
Is it far?

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.680
It's in the back hall.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.039
If it isn't too much trouble...

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.199
Not at all!

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:28.560
We can go right now.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.360
Please, Miss Ye.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.479
This way.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.439
Miss Ye,

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.400
please come in.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.120
It's too messy.

00:02:44.377 --> 00:02:46.560
Master Dong,
you really have a lot of collectibles.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.120
Bronze items,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.719
porcelain, clocks,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.759
and everything.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.439
It's all small stuff,

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.280
nothing major.

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.199
You are being too modest.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.120
Not at all.

00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:58.866
Miss Ye, look,
this Xing Kiln Water Vessel,

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.330
and the double-handled incense burner,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.080
plus these Yuan dynasty
blue-and-white porcelains.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.479
They're all my labor of love.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.479
Often, some collectors

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.319
come here

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.840
to buy and take home.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.479
Just a few days ago,
I sold a bronze sword.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.189
Miss Ye, feel free to look around.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.088
If something catches your eye,
just let me know.

00:03:14.088 --> 00:03:15.200
We can negotiate the price.

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.759
Great!

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.319
But Master Dong,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.039
why do I only see objects,

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.560
and no calligraphy or paintings?

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.879
Miss Ye,
do you like calligraphy and paintings?

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.599
They are downstairs.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.360
I'll take you to see them. Come.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.400
Miss Ye,

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.199
come.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.159
This entire room is full
of calligraphy and paintings.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.199
Feel free to look.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.000
Miss Ye,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240
don't mind this place.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.599
It's a bit worn,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.080
but these are marks of time.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.159
Even my old house

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.560
is part of my collection.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.919
This house itself

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.639
is truly an authentic ancient residence.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.240
How is it?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.680
Master Dong,

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.560
where did you

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.000
get this painting?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.879
I found it at a street stall.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.070
All these are worthless.
The valuable ones are here.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.079
Miss Ye, come over.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.319
Look at these.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.839
These are all genuine works.

00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:35.430
I've already seen all of these.

00:04:35.644 --> 00:04:36.680
Thank you, Master Dong.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.279
You've seen it all?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.279
Miss Ye,

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.279
you didn't like any of them, huh?

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.800
I still have better ones.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.480
Please, Miss Ye.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.920
Miss Ye,

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.120
take care.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.519
Master Dong.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:56.399
Young man,

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.000
you're here.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.044
I brought you some fruit.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.680
You're thoughtful.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.720
I'll take it.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.700
(Rain Manor)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.829
Miss Ye.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.480
The Spring Stream Painting is inside.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.519
We can prepare to act.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.600
I've checked.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.911
This city has exceptional
geographic advantages.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.290
The weather is favorable all year.
No disasters or hardships.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.560
This building is a one-story house
built in the late 1970s.

00:05:24.577 --> 00:05:25.155
Very solid.

00:05:25.177 --> 00:05:27.666
Even if an earthquake occurs,
it would be counterproductive.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.800
No need for drastic measures.

00:05:32.888 --> 00:05:34.630
The owner of the Spring Stream Painting

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.879
doesn't even know
that he has a genuine piece.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.160
We just need to create some

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.079
minor, trivial incidents.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.560
This...

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.977
You even have to think about this?

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.439
Drive.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.399
Yes.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.480
Why did my water pipe burst?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.439
My precious!

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.600
It's all ruined!

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.519
The treasures I've collected
for 30 years!

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.160
They're all flooded!

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.288
Can you stop crying?

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:10.720
You've been crying all night!

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.079
You really give me a headache.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.959
Didn't I tell you it's not serious?

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.959
How is it not serious?

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.439
It's already like this.

00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:18.270
I've looked at these paintings of yours.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.560
None of them is genuine.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.600
The most damaged items are just these.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.879
I have a way to fix the rest.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.759
What way?

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:27.800
Two hundred yuan?

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.399
If so, I might as well hire a cleaner.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.279
You actually think 200 yuan is enough?

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:33.600
I've been busy all night.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.439
Two thousand yuan.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.120
Two thousand yuan?

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.829
This entire room isn't worth 2,000 yuan.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.355
And you're asking me for 2,000 yuan?

00:06:40.377 --> 00:06:41.750
What are you scheming?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.720
Fine.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.279
Then tidy it up yourself.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:51.879
Let's do it together.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.639
Can I offer you 1,000 yuan?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.920
I'll help you.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.399
Just by breaking one water pipe,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.560
we replaced the painting.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.000
Miss Ye's plan is indeed brilliant.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.519
Miss Ye,

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.279
it's genuine.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.399
Good.

00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:11.377
Well done.

00:07:11.377 --> 00:07:13.680
Actually, that person
doesn't understand paintings at all.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.079
Why didn't you just buy it?

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.399
At Fusheng Hall,

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.720
we never alter fixed points in history.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.519
In history,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.480
Master Dong did not sell this painting.

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.519
To avoid the oversight
of the Time Administration,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.319
we had to swap it stealthily.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.120
Though it's troublesome,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.399
it's also safe.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:36.439
The Spring Stream.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.680
The Summer Cooling.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.680
The Winter Chill.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.079
Perfect.

00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:49.510
Only the
Autumn Twilight Painting remains.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.160
Yun,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.720
put these three paintings
in the warehouse.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.199
Then I'll go out first.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:08.879
Miss Ye,

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:11.160
which warehouse
should these paintings go into?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.519
Then put them

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.079
in the 25th-century warehouse.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:17.639
Alright.

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:22.480
By the way,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.399
recently, the Time Administration
has made new moves.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.800
Be very careful when you send them
to the warehouse.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.920
Understood.

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.320
By the way, Miss Ye,

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:34.879
a few days ago, a guest said

00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:36.711
that he has
the Autumn Twilight Painting.

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.600
(If Dushan Jade)

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.000
(also obtained by Fusheng Hall)

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.399
(using the same method as the
Coiled Dragon Bronze Tripod Cauldron,)

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:55.480
(then)

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:57.600
(did someone kill Ziyi)

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:59.480
(before the fire?)

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.440
Mr. Bizhi,

00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:05.000
may I invite you to bring
the Autumn Twilight Painting

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.799
and meet us offline?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:08.960
Yes.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480
You choose the location.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:13.440
The address has been sent.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.870
(The fate of interfering with history)

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.840
(and harming the innocent...)

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.039
(You will know it sooner or later.)

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.799
Mr. Bizhi,

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:39.159
we meet again.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.279
This place is really hard to find.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:43.279
Of course.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.629
The Autumn Twilight Painting

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.560
is a legendary treasure
in the collecting world.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.240
If we go somewhere public,

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:52.159
it might be discovered
by someone with ulterior motives.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.320
A legendary treasure.

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:56.879
Now it's in my hands.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200
You don't care

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.519
how I got it?

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.639
As long as what you bring is genuine,

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:05.279
Fusheng Hall never asks
how you obtained it.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.320
Whether it's genuine,

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:10.200
can you tell?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.159
Of course.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.000
Please wait a little longer.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.039
Of course.

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.789
Last time,
in Fusheng Hall's exhibit list,

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.755
I saw the Coiled Dragon Bronze
Tripod Cauldron.

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:49.559
You must have spent a lot on it.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.639
Yes.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.600
How did you get it?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.480
That Coiled Dragon Bronze
Tripod Cauldron

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:57.279
was originally a cherished item
of an old collector in the past era.

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:59.279
Since information was scarce back then,

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.639
it was kept well hidden.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.960
Later, due to an earthquake,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.799
it left the original owner's hands.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.559
Passing through many hands,

00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:08.240
our colleagues managed to track it down.

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.360
That was indeed not easy.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.240
How about the Dushan Jade?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.679
Has it found a new owner?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.080
Sorry.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.080
Pardon me.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.399
But I'm very interested in that piece.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.080
I can hardly find any information on it.

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:27.399
Could it be

00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:29.320
that it doesn't exist at all?

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840
Or rather,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.120
Fusheng Hall

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.120
intentionally fabricated its background?

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:38.519
We value our reputation
above everything.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:41.080
How could we fabricate a background?

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.679
How did you get

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.639
that Dushan Jade?

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.360
That Dushan Jade

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:58.279
was the family seal of a prestigious
Han dynasty household,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.759
passed down for a thousand years,

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:00.840
surviving many disasters.

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:03.559
Eventually, the descendants
took it overseas.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.120
We also acquired it
at an astronomical price,

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:09.799
so it's not easily auctioned.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:11.080
Astronomical price?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.799
You probably didn't pay a single cent,
did you?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.519
That prestigious family

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:19.720
was surnamed Qin.

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:23.480
That jade could have saved the life
of Young Master Qin.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:26.960
But the envoy delivering
the jade was killed.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.399
Young Master Qin

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.200
also died in the fire.

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:31.759
Or rather,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.600
he was killed by someone
not belonging to that era.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.000
You're asking too much.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:11.679
Hello.

00:13:11.799 --> 00:13:13.000
Mr. Bizhi.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.519
Miss Ning?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.360
If so,

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:22.120
how could Fusheng Hall sell fakes?

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.200
After all, these are genuine pieces
you took from different eras.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.399
Exactly.

00:13:28.044 --> 00:13:29.955
We got the Coiled Dragon Bronze
Tripod Cauldron

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.320
directly from Rain Manor.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.120
The Dushan Jade

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.200
was transported from Luoyang.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.759
If these are fake,

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:40.240
then nothing is real.

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:44.480
About the Autumn Twilight Painting
you brought,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.360
I admit,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.399
it's a good replica,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.399
but it still can't fool me.

00:13:59.577 --> 00:14:01.390
You can tell it's fake
just by touching it?

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.440
Have you seen the original?

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.639
Of course I have.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:08.919
I even saw the painter. His name was...

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.240
What was it?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.600
Gu Zhiqian.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.279
Yes.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.759
Gu Zhiqian.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.039
How did he die?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.120
After getting drunk,

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:22.320
he fell into a pond and drowned.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.679
You killed Gu Zhiqian.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
No way.

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:30.399
He drowned.

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:32.320
It's recorded in history.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.555
The Summer Cooling and the Winter Chill
were taken from him by you!

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.480
These two paintings

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:40.080
were already missing

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.240
from historical records.

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:42.840
At Fusheng Hall,

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:46.720
we return the collections to the last
moment before they were destroyed,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.759
bringing them back intact.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:49.759
The collections?

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:53.440
To me, they are nothing
but stolen goods.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.559
Behind these rare treasures,

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:57.120
who knows how many lives were lost?

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:59.600
To obtain these rare treasures,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.639
you killed and robbed.

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:03.279
Do you think just Gu Zhiqian alone

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:05.279
could secure his place in history?

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.960
The value of art is not only
in the object itself.

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:10.879
We were his patrons.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:14.440
If we hadn't pushed him forward
across different eras,

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:15.799
his reputation

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:17.440
would be nothing more than that

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:19.559
of a struggling, ordinary painter.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.399
Our existence

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.039
helped him fulfill his greatest wish,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.200
to be remembered after death.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.759
What about the Dushan Jade?

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:31.120
Did you kill Young Master Qin

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.559
and his maid Caiwei?

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:35.360
The Dushan Jade?

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:38.080
That happened a long time ago.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.559
I don't remember.

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:42.360
How did the owner
of the Dushan Jade die?

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:57.919
Does it really matter?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.440
No matter what,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.840
these people are

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.960
already dead to us.

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:06.440
So, does it matter how they died?

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.039
Or do you want to go to a specific era

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:14.360
and have some
rare encounters with the dead?

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.399
That doesn't comply

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:19.639
with your Time Administration's rules.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.519
Mr. Commissioner.

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:25.879
What do you mean?

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:30.720
I never meant to harm you,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.639
but the Time Administration

00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:35.240
won't leave us alone.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.159
So,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.000
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.279
Handle it cleanly.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.920
Kill him!

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.279
Make sure to find him.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.720
Yes.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:36.420
(Yashe)

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:54.680
Look over there.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.119
Why is someone lying ahead?

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:56.839
How is he injured?

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:57.960
Why is there so much blood?

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.740
(Rosy Clouds)

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.920
After all, we all know each other.

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:11.359
We can't just leave him like this.

00:19:11.377 --> 00:19:13.160
Tianguang Market isn't a rescue station.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.279
He got himself into trouble.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:17.119
Before the facts are clear,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.240
we can't let him stay here.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:22.799
But Bizhi was so good to us.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.119
Besides, he's also someone
who repays kindness.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.559
We saved him once.

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:29.160
Saving a life is better
than building a seven-story pagoda.

00:19:29.488 --> 00:19:31.400
We're doing good deeds,
and accumulating merit.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.599
Why can't we do that?

00:19:40.355 --> 00:19:42.000
He's already wearing protective gear,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.720
and has saved his life.

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:46.160
Ordinary injuries can self-heal,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.920
but now he still can't recover,

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:50.440
which indicates he was hurt
by weapons from his own era.

00:19:51.822 --> 00:19:54.000
Although we don't know
what he got involved in,

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:57.319
we must never bring any armed force

00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:58.400
into Tianguang Market.

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:01.359
There are many innocent civilians there.

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:03.119
We absolutely cannot put them in danger.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.440
It's just saving a friend.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.440
Do you have to be so naggy?

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.680
As a supervisor
of the Time Administration,

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:27.599
I have to remind you,

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:29.279
not to forget your identity,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.200
and your promise.

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:38.559
I will report this to
the Time Administration.

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:41.079
In the meantime, think carefully.

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:42.279
When I return,

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.880
I don't want to see anyone unrelated
to Tianguang Market

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.519
at Luoxia Manor.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.039
Miss Ye,

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:15.680
we've found the person's hiding place.

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:17.799
Where is he?

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.920
That place

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.119
is not a normal shop.

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:23.440
It's an abandoned time elevator.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.119
He escaped using the elevator.

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:27.799
A time elevator?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.680
And it's abandoned?

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.599
That elevator was not registered.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.480
So the person using
this abandoned elevator

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.160
is not from the Time Administration.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.799
His identity

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:53.480
is just an old city land
redevelopment planner.

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:57.440
An old city land redevelopment planner

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.960
actually has a time elevator?

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.200
Truly unbelievable.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.069
Since he used the time elevator,

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.110
we should be able to track
the destination, right?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.759
We checked.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.279
But we don't know where he went.

00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:13.750
Because the destination's
space-time coordinates

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.111
are just a bunch of gibberish.

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:17.119
How is that possible?

00:22:17.733 --> 00:22:20.000
It's the first time
we've encountered this situation.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.480
Dad.

00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:35.680
Mom.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.119
I came to see you.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.680
I've learned to swim.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.160
Since I can remember,

00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:57.400
you've always been very busy.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.720
I used to complain about you, too.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.240
But now I understand.

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:12.720
You have your own lives,

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.559
and your own matters.

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:16.759
Just like now,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.640
I've returned to work
at the pet hospital.

00:23:21.319 --> 00:23:22.720
And I also signed up

00:23:23.079 --> 00:23:24.559
for the pet veterinarian exam.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.240
I've made myself very busy,

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.400
very busy.

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:38.400
That way, I don't have time
to think about the past.

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:00.880
Bizhi has gone back.

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:08.680
He told me

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.960
that he had something to do

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:17.622
with our car accident.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:23.119
But I believe

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.960
the accident was not caused by him.

00:24:31.759 --> 00:24:32.880
It wasn't

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.160
his intention, either.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.480
So I don't blame him at all.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:46.599
I guess you don't, either.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.880
At least, his appearance

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:54.440
lets me see you once more.

00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:01.519
There are so many people
in this world who've lost loved ones.

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:04.160
I'm the lucky one

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.880
to reunite with you.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.240
But he's gone.

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:18.960
Maybe it's better for me.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.799
I'm not from the same era as him.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.880
One day,

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:27.160
we have to part.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.640
When I was young, it was you two.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.799
Then grandma.

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:35.359
Finally, him.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.759
The people who supported me
are all gone.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.880
It's time for me to grow up, too.

00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:51.240
Alright.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.119
I'm going back to work.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.000
I'll come see you again.

00:26:02.533 --> 00:26:03.510
You're manager, right?

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:03.920
Yes.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.111
I want to complain about him.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.359
Ou is my dog.
The adoption procedure is complete.

00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:09.240
And now you want to take him
back to the shelter?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.799
Miss Li, you know better than anyone
how this dog was raised.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.799
Dogs can't speak,

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:13.839
but we can tell.

00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:15.119
What do you mean?

00:26:15.177 --> 00:26:16.720
Are you saying it's my responsibility?

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.359
What?

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:18.240
Your dog has a problem,

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.200
and now you blame me?

00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:20.720
Miss Li, we're not blaming you.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.200
My colleague may have spoken harshly,

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.759
but we're here to solve the problem.

00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:25.160
I adopted the dog from you,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.279
and now it has a problem.

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:27.720
Your vet says it's my fault.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.119
What?

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:29.000
What do you mean?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.839
Listen!

00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:31.960
I have many fans,
and I can expose your shady clinic!

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.590
We're handling it.

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:33.519
What are you saying?

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.359
Let me handle it.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:35.160
Was I wrong?

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.119
You must speak with facts and evidence.

00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:38.319
Every dog adopted from us...

00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:39.079
Calm down.

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:40.220
We treat them wholeheartedly!

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:41.839
Miss Li, right?

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:42.680
Who are you?

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.200
I'm a doctor here.

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.880
Can I see the dog first?

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:52.720
(Shedding this badly)

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:54.400
(should be due to malnutrition.)

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.279
Your puppy likely has

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.319
Salmonella spiralis rabies.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.359
That's why it has digestive issues

00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:02.480
and looks weak.

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:04.200
Rabies?

00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:06.200
Could it infect me?

00:27:06.288 --> 00:27:08.720
If you live together,
there's a high chance of transmission.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.160
Also, this disease is quite difficult
to treat.

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:12.400
It would probably

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400
cost a lot of money.

00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:19.279
Yes.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.599
Last month, we treated one

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.400
and spent

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.079
30 thousand yuan.

00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:24.000
You're mistaken.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.039
Including post-op care,

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:27.160
it was over 50 thousand yuan.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:27.839
That much?

00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:28.799
Fifty thousand yuan.

00:27:29.155 --> 00:27:30.288
Fifty thousand yuan.

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:32.559
What now?

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:33.640
Do I have to pay this?

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:34.799
No.

00:27:34.955 --> 00:27:36.680
As long as you terminate the adoption,

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.333
you won't be responsible for the cost.

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.599
It's not really about the money.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.359
I just don't feel comfortable leaving it

00:27:45.359 --> 00:27:46.119
at another clinic.

00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:47.799
I'll leave it to you.

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:49.480
Isn't that better?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:49.880
Su.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.288
Take Miss Li to sign
the adoption termination agreement.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.240
This way, please.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.920
Done.

00:27:58.079 --> 00:27:58.839
Everyone, disperse.

00:27:58.839 --> 00:27:59.400
Disperse.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.000
Oh my goodness.

00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:03.160
Not bad, Su Beilu.

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:04.240
You've improved.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.720
Now you have skills.

00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:06.279
Wait,

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:07.839
what you said just now,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.559
the Salmonella spiralis...

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.759
I made it up.

00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:13.519
I knew it.

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:15.000
I never studied this in school.

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:15.839
Enough.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.599
Give it to me.

00:28:16.599 --> 00:28:18.359
I'll communicate with the shelter.

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:20.240
Wait a moment, Su Beilu.

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:22.200
A lady upstairs is waiting for you.

00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:25.839
Waiting for me?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.960
Hello.

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:39.119
Ning?

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:41.079
You should call me

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:42.480
Miss Ye now.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.039
You're not from this era.

00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:51.400
Not from this era,

00:28:51.622 --> 00:28:53.750
does that mean
I can't bring pets to the clinic?

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:57.079
Of course, you can.

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:05.279
I believe Miss Ye didn't come here

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:07.759
just to treat a snake, right?

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:08.920
Correct.

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:11.920
I want to ask,

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:14.559
your good friend Bizhi...

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:16.400
Where did he go?

00:29:22.777 --> 00:29:24.155
What's your relationship with him?

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.480
We're from the same era.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.039
He's my friend.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.839
But I haven't seen him in the future.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.680
So,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.880
do you know where he went?

00:29:42.839 --> 00:29:43.519
He's gone.

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:44.599
He's gone?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.279
He's not my friend, either.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.799
Maybe just my boss.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.960
His work here is done.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.079
So he left.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.279
The house here,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.359
and the shop

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:54.559
are all vacated.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.039
He didn't tell you

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:01.240
how to find him?

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:08.799
How could I contact him?

00:30:09.519 --> 00:30:10.680
I'm someone from here.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.119
During this time,

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:17.799
did he contact you?

00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:19.160
No.

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:29.680
Before he left,

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:32.319
didn't he tell you anything?

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.799
You're from the same era.

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:41.160
It should be fine to tell you, right?

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:44.400
He just said he wouldn't come back,

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:47.279
so it's like he said nothing.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.880
Miss Ye,

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.279
your pet snake is fine.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.319
It's just

00:31:08.355 --> 00:31:09.750
that it's about to shed its skin.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.440
The snake

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:15.079
can be very aggressive during shedding.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.319
Be very careful.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:20.839
Understood.

00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:22.880
Then I'll trouble Dr. Su.

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:25.519
If your good friend Bizhi contacts you,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.960
please let me know.

00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:30.359
I'm also worried about him.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.680
Miss Ye,

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:48.960
do I need to handle that doctor?

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:51.880
No need.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.319
He didn't lie.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.119
Maybe Bizhi didn't tell him anything

00:31:57.559 --> 00:31:58.759
to protect him.

00:31:58.777 --> 00:32:00.400
Then we'll head back to headquarters.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.279
Why?

00:32:02.555 --> 00:32:03.920
The Hall Master wants you back.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:06.759
The Time Administration
has been strict lately.

00:32:06.839 --> 00:32:08.720
Our actions have already
drawn their attention.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.720
To ensure the safety of each warehouse,

00:32:10.733 --> 00:32:12.600
the Hall Master asks you
to return immediately.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.799
Understood.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.759
Miss Ye claims to be Bizhi's friend,

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.160
but on that day at Rain Manor,

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.960
Bizhi had no reaction when he saw her.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.480
They didn't look like they
even knew each other.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.160
That woman

00:33:03.599 --> 00:33:04.680
must be lying.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.200
Right?

00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:17.559
That woman isn't just lying.

00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:21.480
She also tried to prick me
with a needle.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.119
But if Bizhi is in the future,

00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:29.119
Miss Ye wouldn't be searching
for him everywhere.

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:33.279
But if Bizhi isn't in the future,

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:35.279
then where would he be?

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:44.279
Tuanzi,

00:33:44.755 --> 00:33:46.600
you feel something's wrong, too, right?

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:52.359
Bizhi might be in danger.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.119
Su?

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.840
You want to enter Tianguang Market?

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.000
I want to ask you

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:16.480
how you got in back then?
