=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.762
=Episode 7=
(When Guilt Comes Calling at Midnight)

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.519
He… he's gone!

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.480
Looks like Zhong Kui devoured
that magistrate, bones and all.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.800
This is eerie indeed.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:24.360
If you ask me, I don't think
this was the deed of Zhong Kui.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.599
Feels more like a vengeful spirit.

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:27.279
Silence!

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.260
Any more nonsense and I'll have you all
tied up and thrown to feed the spirits.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.760
Divine Lady Thrush.

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.239
Do you have any way to break this curse?

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.559
I can set up a ritual to dispel it.

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:40.919
Tomorrow at the You hour,

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:42.800
have your men
prepare everything for the altar.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.279
Everyone in the stronghold
must be present.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.479
The thrush appeared!

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.559
Yes. Look!

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.199
Ever still and unchanging.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.839
Without arrival or return.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.919
Understand what is real.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:37.600
Recognize what is evil.

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.759
Strip away all illusions.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.080
Perceive the void.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.039
This is purified talisman water.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.639
Each of you drink some.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.520
It'll drive away the evil

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.240
and keep it from returning.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.720
Men.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.279
Stop!

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.479
That woman's just putting on an act.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.260
Her intentions are questionable.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.360
There's got to be something
in that water.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.639
- Chief!
- Chief!

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.199
Seize that sorceress!

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.080
- Chief!
- Chief!

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.330
Good thing you kept things
under control, Deputy Chief.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.520
I have a proposal.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.679
Would you care to hear me out?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.119
Men!

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.800
Eat and feast!
Drink to your heart's content!

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.399
Great!

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.600
- Come on now! Bottoms up!
- Let's drink!

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.520
Come on!

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:08.479
Here!

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.720
Chief Huang.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.399
Congratulations. Here.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.759
Cheers.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.639
Drink up!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.399
Let's have a toast.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.640
I know the schedules and paths

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.040
of those tax silvers and official funds
escorted along

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.040
the Huachang County routes
better than anyone.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:26.640
We can discuss how to close the books

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.839
and split the profit.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.200
Come. Let's fill your cup.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.559
Please.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.799
Drink.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.839
Bottoms up!

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.279
Bottoms up!

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.000
Don't just eat. Drink up! Come on!

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:39.839
This is good liquor.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.119
This is not bad.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.040
Good liquor.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.480
What's the matter?

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.399
Did I disappoint you?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.559
One day, you'll learn this world

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:01.359
serves only those who serve themselves,

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:04.640
and who know how to plot

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:08.279
for themselves.

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:11.600
You're still too naive.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.690
You trusted me
just because I spared you.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.519
Let this be your lesson.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.990
Next time, don't hold back

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.119
against your enemy.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.799
She has ulterior motives,

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:26.440
but as things stand,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.160
she can't stir up much trouble.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.480
Master Lu, if she curries your favor,

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.119
why not take her

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.079
as a concubine?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.959
If you're worried about people talking,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.200
you can always

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.000
keep her here in the stronghold.

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:41.000
Excellent idea. Thank you, Huang.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.119
She's very much to my taste.

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:44.600
It'd be a pity to kill her.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.239
Drink up!

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:02.320
Look at that.

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:07.160
- Great!
- Great!

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.320
Come on, men!

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.679
Fill those cups!

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:22.440
- Great!
- Great!

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:30.040
- Great!
- Great!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.000
Here, here.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.200
Come on. Bottoms up!

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.519
Drink!

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.880
Fill them up!

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.679
Carry on.

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:45.959
Keep going. Come on. Bottoms up!

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:00.600
Can you do it?

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.660
Don't even think about it!

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.990
I'll take the lead then.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:25.200
Seize them!

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.480
It's just you.

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:39.160
We're on the same side.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.279
Drink with us…

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.239
Ow…

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.970
Take them back
to the magistrate's office.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.920
You thought this through.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.760
If the troops show up,

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:04.119
then your plan worked perfectly.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.959
If they don't,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.440
then you'd thrown in your lot

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.320
with the bandits.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.119
Yes.

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:10.000
You know me well.

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:12.000
Watch your tone with me, though.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.839
Or have you given up on your case?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.490
Worst comes to worst,
I'll go to County Magistrate Jiang.

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:23.640
There must be a misunderstanding.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.359
Magistrate Lu's upstairs

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.920
right now.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.119
Silence.

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:29.079
Take him away.

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:38.039
Release me! Let me go!

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.239
Don't move. Stay still.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.840
Move it.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.239
Let me go!

00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:48.919
Move it.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.919
You…

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.700
Sir, have you seen Huang Baocheng?
He's the leader of these bandits.

00:08:53.719 --> 00:08:56.040
We've searched everywhere
except the dense woods out back.

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:07.479
You're an interesting one.

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:09.760
You seem driven by gain alone,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.479
yet you never quite mean what you say.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.760
I saw it

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.400
with my own eyes just now.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.080
You fed something

00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:18.479
to that woman.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.599
It's none of your concern.

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:29.400
Baotian's sleeve bracer's
always coated with poison.

00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:30.919
You and her

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.679
were poisoned.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.159
You risked your life
to feed her the antidote,

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:38.559
yet she didn't appreciate it at all.

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:39.919
But it doesn't matter.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:42.559
She'll never be able
to return the favor.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:46.200
Is that the murder weapon?

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.479
Is this what you used

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.840
to hack off your father,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.679
Huang Agen's head?

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.750
(Spirit tablet of Huang Agen,
deceased in the third month of the Jihai year)

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.937
(Honored by his sons
Huang Baocheng and Huang Baotian)

00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:03.320
So that's what this was all for.

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.159
Truth is,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.239
he swallowed his last breath on his own.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200
Do you know

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.280
how long it takes a man
to starve to death?

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.440
Four to five days for most people.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:17.000
At his age,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.719
two days without food or water

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.599
was enough.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:22.799
When he died,
his face was ghastly and purple.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.760
His eyes were wide open

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.039
and staring right at me.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.840
So you starved
your own father to death,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.280
cut off his head,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.840
and used it to pass as Shen Xiu's head
to claim the reward.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.280
Want to know

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.760
how I dealt with that old fool?

00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:46.440
I tied him up

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.960
with rope like this,

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.200
and carried him up the mountain.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.880
I left him in a wooden basin,

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:54.679
exposed him to the sun for days,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.039
then soaked him in water

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:59.919
until his face completely rotted away.

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:02.719
Then, I branded Li Ji's mark onto him.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.880
Li Ji?

00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:05.719
- The mark?
- Yes.

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:07.799
I needed that mark

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.520
to seal the crime

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:11.200
and collect the reward.

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:13.960
If you came to investigate this case,

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:15.880
you're looking for the wrong man.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.320
The one who paid for a fake head

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.640
was Zhao Chengxi.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.479
Zhao Chengxi.

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:23.620
He's who you should be after.

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.039
Too bad

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.559
you won't live to see another day.
