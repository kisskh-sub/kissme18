00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.560
Editor-in-Chief

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.039
Coffee's ready.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.840
The First Reunion

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.200
Editor-in-Chief

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.000
What do you think?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.560
What do you think?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.120
I think it's well written.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.799
Okay?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.719
That's not good.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.319
You've been a book editor

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.599
for so many years.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:22.480
Can't you be a bit more confident?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.799
It's well written.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:24.599
Well written, my...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.640
It's not good.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.480
Du Xiaoxi

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.519
Why did we come to Shenzhen?

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.040
For our dreams?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
No.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.239
Why are we in publishing?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.640
For art?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.760
No.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.959
Why do we publish

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.879
books like this?

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.159
To make money.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.640
For dreams and art.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.920
Editor-in-Chief, what do you want?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.120
Just tell me directly.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.560
I...

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.280
I'm really a bit

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.560
lost with your train of thought.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.480
Sit.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.680
Literature is in decline.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.959
No one wants to read books anymore.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.719
They only want to read

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.480
"Get rich in three days"

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.800
"Cure mental burnout in five days"

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.599
"Seven days to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.479
save you from midlife crisis."

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.879
If I don't publish this trash,

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.360
how can I support those

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.719
that aren't trash?

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.840
Editor-in-Chief...

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.560
I understand what you mean.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.479
You're saying

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.159
this book will be published later?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.840
No.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.960
It won't sell.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.199
How could that be?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.039
This Teacher Suan

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.319
has published two books before,

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.479
and they were well-received.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.599
Times have changed.

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.680
She never goes out.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.479
Unwilling to promote herself.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.080
No online traffic.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.400
She's a writer,

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.680
not an internet celebrity.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.680
No traffic, no readers.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.800
I think

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.759
the concept of this book

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.719
is very interesting.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.800
It's about

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.840
how at certain points

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.120
in the world,

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.759
due to changes in gravitational fields,

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.319
causing differences in the flow of time

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.319
and spacetime curvature,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.960
people from two different times

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.080
can communicate across time.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.080
That's fascinating!

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.719
The male and female leads in this book,

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.560
these two people...

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.800
Xiaoxi, Xiaoxi!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.639
This "Suan Tang" dumpling...

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.639
Editor-in-Chief?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.120
It's just Suan Tang.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.039
Right, no dumplings.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.560
This Suan Tang,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080
is he a relative of yours?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.039
No.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.560
Then why are you pushing so hard

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.280
to recommend it?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.360
If you have the energy

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.159
and the time,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.919
learn a thing or two from Pipi.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.719
Learn to use AI like him,

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.439
or learn to flatter like him?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.520
What?

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.120
What?

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.479
Going to the restroom.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.960
There's paper in the restroom.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.840
So funny.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:00.639
Xiaoxi.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.960
You know this book

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.159
means a lot to me.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.719
Please help me think of a way.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.240
A way...

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.639
Well, there might be one.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:13.319
Right?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.879
Great! Any way will do.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.639
Tell me.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.839
Are you willing to be an internet celebrity?

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.240
Right, you have to do live sales,

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:23.519
or post suggestive content?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.399
I'm not really cut out for that suggestive stuff.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.040
Sis, sis!

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.560
Sis!

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.560
Don't get me wrong.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:28.920
What I mean is,

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:30.560
you could work with us

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.800
to build an online persona

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.240
as a talented woman.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:34.680
Make up some tragic, beautiful stories.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.839
Talk about the pen name "Suan Tang"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.360
and the hardships behind it, and...

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.759
Or maybe you should find another job?

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.040
Who says literature is dead?

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:16.680
Who says no one reads?

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.160
Look at all these people!

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.360
One...

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.800
(Don't go to the hospital)

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.480
What is this?

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.160
This person...

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.279
One Hundred Years of Solitude

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.040
is also my favorite book.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.240
You have many unique ideas.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.040
Of course, the most imaginative one

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.519
is saying Shenzhen has snow.

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.839
Because since historical records began,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.920
Shenzhen has never...

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.800
Boss?

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:47.040
I'd like another sticky note, please.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.879
Thank you.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.759
Page twenty-one.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.720
Who is it?

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.920
So bored.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.319
Stop hiding!

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.839
I see you.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.720
I'll catch you.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.720
Wake up.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.920
Wake up, wake up.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.240
Why are you sleeping here?

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:17.240
The floor is so cold.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.199
Get up.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.120
Boss?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.920
I fell asleep.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.600
Yeah.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.480
I was originally...

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.480
What are you doing?

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.879
Almost got it.

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.120
Lost track of it.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.679
Twenty, twenty.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:54.279
What on earth are you doing?

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:55.960
Boss.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.960
Has anyone touched this copy of

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.399
*One Hundred Years of Solitude*?

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:01.679
Yes.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.399
Who?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.159
Isn't that you?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.919
I'm obviously asking about

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:07.440
someone other than me.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:08.360
Then no.

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:09.320
You're lying.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.480
There's surveillance.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:12.960
Right here.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.279
There's no one.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:15.960
Are you trying to say

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.240
your shop is haunted?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.360
Don't scare me.

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:24.639
Who's scaring you?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.039
How else do you explain

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.320
someone leaving me a note saying,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.200
"Shenzhen is snowing."

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.279
When has Shenzhen ever

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.240
had snow?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.559
Who says Shenzhen never had snow?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.320
I remember it was

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.600
January of 2016.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.000
It was even on the news.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.919
2016?

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720
Let me search for it.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.799
You still don't believe me?

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.679
Don't trick me.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.480
January 24th.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.879
Isn't that the day I started this job?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.720
But you call *this* snow?

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.639
Where I'm from, we'd call it at most

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.480
graupel.

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:00.799
You're from the north.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:01.679
You...

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:02.799
can't understand the feeling

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.720
we get from seeing snow.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:05.200
That still doesn't make sense.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.200
This note...

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.799
2016.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.320
At certain coordinate points

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.480
in the world,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.039
due to changes in gravitational fields,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.559
the flow of time differs,

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:15.720
and spacetime bends,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.279
enabling people from two different times

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.440
to communicate across time.

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:19.879
No way.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:34.240
What year is it where you are?

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:53.360
What year is it where you are?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.799
What kind of question is that?

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.320
Boss.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.480
I've decided.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:12.440
I'm quitting.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:13.840
To become a full-time writer.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320
Don't try to keep me.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.840
Who wants to keep you?

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.000
If you don't resign voluntarily,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.440
I'll fire you directly.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.720
You've been here for two years,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.639
your performance is always last.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.080
Then I won't resign.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:33.639
You fire me.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.840
That way,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.559
do I get N+1 compensation?

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.600
Get out.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:51.600
Bye-bye.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.240
This is your workstation.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.240
Work hard with me.

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:06.320
I have high hopes for you.

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.399
Thank you, Teacher Wen.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.600
I will definitely work hard.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.720
Everyone.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.519
This is our new colleague,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.639
Du Xiaoxi.

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:14.480
Hello, everyone.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360
Alright, back to work.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.399
Hello.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.039
Hi there.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.480
What do you mean, be a writer?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.759
Come back home properly

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:35.480
and be a civil servant for me.

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:36.480
Mom.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.080
I'm an adult now.

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:39.240
Let me make my own decisions.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.120
Is that so hard?

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:41.000
Nan.

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.240
Don't argue with me.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:43.840
Gang.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.080
Tomorrow, I'll have your sister

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.120
go to Shenzhen to bring you back.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.519
I'm not coming back.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.080
It's been days since I hit you.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.960
If you don't come back, I'm afraid you'll starve.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.320
Can a hobby put food on the table?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.799
Can you eat properly or not?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.879
Hurry up.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080
If you don't eat it, I'll feed it to the dog.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.440
Mom.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.759
Give me a little more time, okay?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.320
"The time left for Team China

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:05.960
is running out."

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:10.840
Mom, believe me.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.759
I will definitely write

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:13.360
a masterpiece known to every household.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.399
Believe you?

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.840
Unless it snows in Shenzhen.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:21.720
Lost again.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.320
Let it snow.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.720
Sorry, sorry.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.960
It's snowing.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.240
It's really snowing.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.840
Stop shushing.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.600
Look quickly!

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720
It's really snowing.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.840
It's really snowing.

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:10.960
It's snowing! It's snowing!

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:11.480
Go take a look.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.399
Great!

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.399
Aren't you from the northeast?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.559
Why are you more excited about snow than I am?

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.480
2016.

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:10.480
Du Xiaoxi.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.480
Book editor.

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:12.279
Female.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.720
What a coincidence, me too.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:15.960
You're a girl too?

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.320
I said I'm also a book editor.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.600
But I quit.

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:22.240
My name is Chen Mo.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.480
You can also call me the Great Literary Master.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.159
Now I'm one hundred percent sure

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.240
you're a guy.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.000
Your handwriting is pretty good.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.600
Your handwriting...

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.679
needs practice.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:44.360
So, where you are,

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.600
it's really 2016?

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.960
I, without hesitation,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960
believe you are in 2025.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.440
Why don't you believe me?

00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:52.720
If you put it that way,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.279
in my world,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.759
wouldn't you be an old man?

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:57.360
Big sister.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.039
In 2025,

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.559
I'll only be thirty-five, okay?

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.360
Calling a girl "big sister"

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.039
isn't polite, is it?

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:06.120
Then, little sister?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.360
May I ask your age?

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.759
Asking a girl her age

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:10.639
is even less polite, right?

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.320
Alright, alright, I won't ask.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:13.960
What's your zodiac sign?

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.559
Isn't that the same thing?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.840
I might as well tell you.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.399
I'm thirty-one.

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:21.879
So that means,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.440
right now you're the older sister,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.480
but actually you're the younger one.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.240
So from now on, I'll call you

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.240
"Sister."

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.039
Sister.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.480
What's 2025

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.200
like now?

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.840
Are robots everywhere?

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:41.960
Your imagination is too rich.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.200
Actually, 2025

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.120
isn't much different

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.000
from 2016.

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:48.559
Go on.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:49.919
What else do you want to know?

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:52.360
Have I...

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.159
become famous?

00:16:57.679 --> 00:16:58.360
Okay, okay.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.080
Then I must have published at least two

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.000
bestsellers, right?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.480
Okay, okay, okay.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.359
Then I must have at least

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.720
published a book or two, right?

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:07.680
Let me check for you.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.359
Okay.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.240
What's your name?

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.119
Chen Mo.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.240
Pen name?

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:14.839
Chen Mo.

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:19.559
Silent.

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:27.559
So sad.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.519
Wanna cry.

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.000
This is really

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.359
a 2016 meme.

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:34.279
It's okay.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.720
I believe there will be a miracle.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.119
Just hang in there a bit longer.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:40.680
What if it's right?

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:43.000
I believe it too.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.480
Alright.

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:47.480
Get some rest early.

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:49.000
Good night.

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:50.559
Good night.

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:19.519
Sit down.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.359
Sit down.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.240
Hello, boss.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.319
Boss, the usual, please.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:46.880
You got it.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.880
Americano, with ice.

00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:25.039
After all our tests,

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.079
we found we can only connect

00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:28.359
at this spot on the bookshelf,

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:30.440
using this copy of *One Hundred Years of Solitude*.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.240
That's the only way.

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:33.720
And we can only pass notes.

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:35.720
Last time you tried to send a shoe,

00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:37.079
sticking it in the book failed.

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:39.279
How did you even get a shoe in a book?

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:43.599
Maybe

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.960
it can only transmit words.

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:48.680
Tell me,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.599
how do we

00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:51.400
explain this scientifically?

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:55.200
I read a novel once.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.559
It said that

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:57.680
at certain coordinate points

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.200
in the world,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.160
due to changes in the gravitational field,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.880
the flow of time and space varies,

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.000
and spacetime bends.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.759
This allows people from two different times

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:06.799
to communicate across time.

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:07.200
Meeting adjourned.

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.400
What novel?

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:10.839
This one...

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:12.279
Just hearing it,

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:14.559
sounds very scientific.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.119
What's up with Xiaoxi lately?

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.119
She's been giggling for ages.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.799
Acting all mysterious.

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:26.319
Who? Who is it? Who?

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.319
The boss is here!

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:30.279
I've discovered

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:32.200
we have a lot in common.

00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:33.279
Really?

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.359
Of course.

00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:35.119
Look.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.480
We both like Song Dynasty poetry.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.519
I like Su Shi.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.200
You like Wang Anshi.

00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:43.119
We both like French literature.

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:44.880
I like Stendhal.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.519
You like Flaubert.

00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:48.160
And British drama.

00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:49.920
I like Wilde.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.240
You like Shaw.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.359
You also like watching soccer.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.640
I like

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:56.000
Ronaldo, Messi.

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:57.599
Alright.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680
We have nothing in common.

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:01.839
I'm just teasing you.

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:04.640
At least

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:06.519
we both like *One Hundred Years of Solitude*.

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:10.000
Thanks to Gabriel García Márquez

00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:11.920
for letting us meet.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.440
Xiaoxi,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.400
let's meet.
