She hasn't arrived even though
we've been waiting for some time.

that she's a deity?

she possessed supernatural powers.

Why do you look different from
how you were during the day?

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:06.600
Sir, do you like
how I look during the day?

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.920
Or do you like the current me?

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.480
No matter if you're
a saintess or a demoness,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760
I like both versions of you.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.401

to that good-for-nothing
who clings to power?

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.770
What's the point of reporting it to him?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.360
So what if he finds out?

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:01.920

Wait.

(Jiang Chun, Country Magistrate)
Were you

00:07:11.413 --> 00:07:12.320

(Jiang Chun, Country Magistrate)
that Mr. Fan

00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:14.480
(of Huachang County)
would die in three days?

I was just reading
the description of his fate.

on his way to chop some wood.

00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:38.680
We found an item that belonged
to the victim at the crime scene.

00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.320
It was Mr. Fan's jade ring.

00:07:41.521 --> 00:07:43.281
If so, I never had time to act.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.480
Such nonsense. Do you have any alibi?

This place is so remote
that no one ever comes here.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.600
It'll be a huge joke

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.920
if you seek a child in the temple

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.800
or an old man in the village
to be your alibi.

00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:54.600

to say that I'm a joke?
