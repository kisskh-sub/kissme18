00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:38.640
Our recent

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:39.640
live streaming data

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.799
has had some issues.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:41.759
As a result,

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.439
our weight was downgraded by the platform.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.520
All of Four Seas' live streaming data for the past six months

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:48.799
appears normal,

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:49.880
but in reality,

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.560
the return rate has hit a record high.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.159
So I suspect

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.439
that someone

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:56.600
paid a high price

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.280
to inflate the data.

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:59.840
Are you and Lin Xiang officially together?

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.079
Of course not.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.040
It's better if we just stay friends.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.560
What about that day at the movies...

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.200
Please don't bring that up!

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.840
It's all Wen Pei'an's fault.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.239
He pulled that stunt,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.879
and I just acted on impulse.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.760
Thinking about it now is mortifying.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.079
My brother was worried sick.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.439
He told me to go fishing.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.451
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:17.480
What do you mean?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.599
I didn't expect

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.159
to catch a big one.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.359
According to my investigation,

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.159
Lin Xiang, ever since his school days,

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.439
has been using the pretense of scouting models

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.599
to deceive many girls.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.239
Models?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.799
Yes.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:35.680
Don't be shocked just yet.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.920
This is just the appetizer.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.719
The Lin Group

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.159
has been wanting to expand into online business for years.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.439
Lin Xiang happens to be in charge of that.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.959
So for all these years,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.920
openly and covertly,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.640
he's been relentlessly sabotaging Four Seas.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.120
This time, the fake live streaming data

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.519
is definitely connected to him.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.920
So,

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.400
he got close to me

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.040
in order to...

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.159
What do you think?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.439
Did your brother ask you to investigate this?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.280
My brother was frantic with worry.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.000
Old Qian!

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.639
Old Qian!

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.039
What's your problem?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.960
No matter what,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.680
we've been friends for decades.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.479
The kids are just dating,

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.280
and you're putting on airs with me?

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.360
Right?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.639
The young couple had a fight.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.919
It's fine.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.800
Don't worry.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.479
Young people's matters

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.000
should be left for them to sort out.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.919
No problem.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.719
My daughter is currently in Turkey.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.400
How could she be dating?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.800
Let's go.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840
Turkey?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Then who is dating my son?

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:56.719
You brat!

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.960
How dare you trick me!

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.719
Dad!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.840
Mom!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.159
What are you doing here?

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:17.439
You two...

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.919
When are you planning to get the marriage certificate?

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.520
Is that all?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.800
You didn't have to come all this way.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.120
We...

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.240
plan to get it next month.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.479
Getting it next month, huh?

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.120
That's fine too.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.080
Then I'll

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.439
book the banquet first.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.560
Two hundred tables.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.960
Dad, there's no need to rush.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.599
Not in a rush, you say?

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.599
Alright then.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.560
We'll wait until you secure your inheritance rights.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.199
Okay?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.840
Right.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.800
Nonsense!

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.280
I almost fell for your trick, you rascal!

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.680
I'm sorry, Uncle.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.120
This whole thing...

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.240
it's all my fault.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.560
Dad,

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.280
I planned this all by myself.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.319
Don't blame Xin Tong.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.319
No.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:11.680
This matter

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.759
has nothing to do with him.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.120
It's not your fault.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.040
It was me.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.639
It was me

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.000
who fell for Wen Pei'an first.

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:32.759
Qian Kexin and I are good friends.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.519
That day, she asked me for a favor.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.160
To go on a blind date in her place.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.160
But when I got there,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.879
and met Wen Pei'an,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.399
the two of us just...

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.680
fell in love at first sight.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:51.720
But,

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.560
because my family background isn't good,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.759
I was afraid our backgrounds were incompatible.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.079
Pei'an

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:58.720
was also afraid

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.240
you two would be disappointed.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.600
He was very worried about your health.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.920
So, I took it upon myself

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.000
to come up with this bad idea.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.480
I'm sorry.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.720
You say you've always liked my son.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.399
What exactly do you like about him?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.360
Yeah.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.079
What do you like about him?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.279
His money?

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.040
Tell us.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.879
I like...

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.519
What I like

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.279
is the Wen Pei'an right in front of me.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.879
In other people's eyes,

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:34.319
he might be a CEO.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.199
In your eyes,

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:38.920
he's a very unique child.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.879
But in my eyes,

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.800
I think he's a

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.800
very adorable big boy.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.160
He's always so concerned about me.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.879
Concerned about my work,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.319
concerned about my life,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.319
concerned about

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.319
all my

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.560
tiny, insignificant little wishes.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.360
So I feel

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.319
that to me,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.519
he's not just

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.240
a good friend.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.240
He's a wonderful partner.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:13.120
Sometimes, just seeing him

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:14.759
makes me so happy.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.319
When he's by my side,

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:18.800
it makes me feel

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.519
very secure

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.279
and very safe.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.160
So,

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.839
I truly, really like him.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.240
I'm really sorry.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.399
Uncle, Auntie.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.600
We were just

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.199
too afraid of disappointing you.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.720
That's why I pretended to be Qian Kexin.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.399
I really didn't want to lie to you.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.480
But I really had no way

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.759
to control myself.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.120
To control

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.000
myself from liking him.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.439
What are you looking at?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.240
I told you not to come, not to come!

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.240
But you insisted on coming.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.920
You old man!

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.120
You're so old,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.439
worrying about useless things all day.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.399
I was just

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:12.920
worried about our son!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.120
Xiao Xin,

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:17.839
let me tell you something.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.519
"Incompatible backgrounds"

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.279
doesn't count in our Wen family.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.000
It's not a thing.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.639
Back in the day,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720
your uncle here,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.079
was considered a famous

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:30.079
rich heir in Jiangcheng.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.160
My marriage with your aunt

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.680
was a love marriage!

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.399
What I valued

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.480
was character.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:38.480
Right?

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.399
Your aunt

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.560
is also very beautiful,

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:43.759
very capable,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.800
and has a great figure.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:45.560
Right?

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:46.800
That's more like it.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:49.800
Uncle,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.480
you've always been my idol.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.920
Pei'an always says

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.360
he hopes to

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.759
become an outstanding entrepreneur like you.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.560
Right?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.800
Yes.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.800
Good, good.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:06.600
Alright, alright.

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.160
It's getting late.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.000
Your father and I

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.879
should head back.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.040
Yes, yes, yes.

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:12.959
Your dad saw Old Qian today,

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.120
and got so angry,

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:15.680
he didn't even eat.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:17.399
He dragged me here.

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:18.560
Let's go.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.759
Uncle, Auntie,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.240
since that's the case,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.319
why don't you stay

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:22.959
for dinner?

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:24.560
Or better yet, don't leave tonight.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.560
Stay here directly.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.199
I'll cook you both a delicious meal.

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:28.600
I'm a great cook.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.120
Right?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.160
See?

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:31.279
A daughter

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.440
is better than a son.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.039
Why did you have to make them stay?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.960
The Chairman is my bread and butter.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.279
Of course I have to be nice to him.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.039
What kind of food do Mom and Dad like?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.159
Cantonese food.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.600
Learning on the spot again?

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:57.480
What else?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.919
I forgot to ask you.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.759
How was my

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120
performance just now?

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.360
Come on, come on.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:06.919
Let's

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.519
have a drink.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.200
Okay.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.440
You've worked hard.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:11.240
Not at all.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.000
I'm so happy today.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:16.120
Slow down, slow down.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:16.799
Uncle,

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:18.720
let me toast you again.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:19.559
Okay, okay, okay.

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.360
Bottoms up!

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:21.919
Okay.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:22.519
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:27.600
Let me pour you some more.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.600
Okay, okay, okay.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.360
Dad

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.000
Mom

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.039
I'm going to bed first.

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:38.360
Alright.

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:39.240
Go to sleep.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.399
And Xin Tong,

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:43.399
you should go rest early too.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.240
Son,

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.120
take Xin Tong with you.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.519
Let her rest too.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.240
Mom...

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.360
Then we'll go rest now.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.159
Go on, go on.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.440
Let's go.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:57.559
Young people just need a good sleep,

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.279
and they'll be fine.

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:09.240
I can still keep drinking.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360
Son,

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:52.799
are you asleep?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.120
Mom.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.120
I made a bowl of hangover soup.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.960
When Xin Tong wakes up,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.279
give it to her to drink.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.240
Thanks, Mom.

00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:03.960
You should rest early too.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.759
I'll just leave it here then.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.919
Alright.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.559
Now the performance is successfully over.

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:16.159
Remember to pay me my wages.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:16.960
Double.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.360
Was she drunk,

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:26.759
or was she not drunk?

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:28.399
Was it a dream,

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.720
or was she sober?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:44.799
Three.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.639
She's so carefree,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.440
she definitely doesn't remember what happened yesterday.

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:54.360
Four.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.039
How did we end up kissing?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.399
Focus on the exercise.

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:07.240
Don't think about it.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.080
How did we kiss...
