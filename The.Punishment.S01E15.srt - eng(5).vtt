00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.470
Give me the key.

Mai.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.790
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.650
If there's any problem, I'll take
responsibility. Just give it to me.

You could have walked away from this,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.910
yet you insisted on taking the fall.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.710
You were looking at a year or two,

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.560
but now it's seven or eight.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.420
Was it worth it?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200
When you're out here in the streets,

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.020
you've got to live by the code, don't you?

Muzhi,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.030
your people management skills
aren't very good.

Why don't we kick out

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.470
all those people from Longwan?

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.030
No way.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.720
I must work with Liu Tianye.

Qin Feng is a police officer.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.470
If we run into any trouble down the road,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.080
with them as our shield,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.340
we'll be much safer.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.410
Well,

should we get some blood
on their hands, too?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.290
I think that's a good approach.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.480
We need to learn

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.820
from Ma Jin's mistake.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.930
We can't follow in Ma Jin's footsteps.

Who did it?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.370
Su Hongbao. He was Ma Jin's subordinate.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.430
Su Hongbao used to be

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.630
a tough guy in Hanzhou.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.240
Tough guy? He's just an old guy.

You can't be so impulsive.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.200
Let's have some drinks.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.780
Come on.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.240
I can't drink.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.260
I have to drive in a bit.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.320
I know you've got an issue with me.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.910
About Xu Li's case,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.000
and Xiaoyue's case...

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.910
I know you have a lot to say.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.270
Today it's just the two of us.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.300
Whatever's on your mind, just say it.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.120
There's nothing to say.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.150
But you can't keep
being so depressed, can you?

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.330
You're different from me.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.840
I'm already this old.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.680
I'm retiring in a few years.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.930
You still have a long way to go.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.470
Well, who told you I'm depressed?

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.790
Can't I see it for myself?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.000
All right.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.660
Let's not talk about this.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.440
Let's talk about something else.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.510
I have another protégé named Zeng Xu.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.630
He

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.570
really admires you

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.670
and has always wanted to meet you.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.730
When you have time,

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.280
let's have a meal together.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.510
No.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.400
I, Mai Hongchao, only have two juniors:

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.030
one named Qin Feng

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.450
and another named Hu Xiaoyue.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.240
But Hu Xiaoyue is dead,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.080
and the person who forced him to die

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.250
still hasn't been brought to justice.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.510
Xu Li's case

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.150
and Hu Xiaoyue's case,

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.330
I haven't forgotten them.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.320
It's all in my heart.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.480
The truth will come to light eventually.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.510
Trust me.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.480
But I just hope you

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.730
can take good care of yourself.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.690
Understand?

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:37.510
Okay.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.650
I'll make contact with Su Hongbao.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.250
As for my situation,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.950
you don't need to worry about it.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.550
If you really mean well,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.150
then get to the bottom

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.680
of Xiaoyue's case
and Xu Li's case.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.860
That's what would really help me.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:11.840
What do you mean?

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.200
Nothing.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.840
I'm not used to people
treating me to meals.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.790
Where's Tianfei?

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.870
I couldn't reach him.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.200
Where... where's your friend, Mr. Wei?

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.470
Mr. Wei...

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.070
He should be here soon.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.030
What's in this shipment?

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.400
Why is this square-shaped?

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.870
Phones?

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.240
That must be Mr. Wei.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.030
We're here, Bro.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.890
Is that Mr. Wei?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.150
Peng.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.670
Mr. Wei.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.050
Nice to meet you.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.860
Let me introduce you.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:18.670
[Mr. Wei, Meat Wholesaler]

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.440
Mr. Liu.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.870
Mr. Wei.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.200
He's the largest meat wholesaler

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.060
in the south district of Hanzhou.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.610
Let's talk about the price first.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.790
It's half the market price.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.040
Is the supply stable?

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.320
We have two ships and ten trucks now.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.780
We can deliver twice a day.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.190
Your smuggling business
is doing quite well.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.110
But besides meat,

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.160
we can transport anything.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360
It just depends on

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.760
whether you want to expand your business
in Hanzhou, Mr. Wei.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.200
To be honest,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.750
I have three wholesale markets
in the south district.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.200
As long as your goods are cheap enough,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.130
I'll move as much as you can supply.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.250
Then it's a deal.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.120
Tianye.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.710
About today's meat business...

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.790
He Biao

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.900
doesn't know about it, right?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.000
Wait, you and He Biao...

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.790
Mr. Wei, you're working

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.660
with Mr. He

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.750
as well, huh?

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.200
I'm not familiar with him, either.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.000
I was just asking casually.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.960
But if we're going

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.320
to work together regularly,
I need to understand

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.150
how things work around here, right?

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.960
Yes.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.960
My business with Mr. He is one thing.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.960
This is

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.360
Longwan's own business.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.470
If you have concerns,

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.710
I think you should reconsider.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.830
Think it over.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.020
I have no concerns.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:53.460
Well,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.330
to be honest,

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.870
I can't stand He Biao's gang, either.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.720
-Peng and I are friends, right?
-Yes. Yes.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.630
Between us...

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.260
We're on the same team.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.790
We're on the same team.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.630
Then let's

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.630
make money together.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.550
Make big money!

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.150
Make big money together.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.670
Let me introduce my two bros—

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.480
Chen and Ran.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.550
If you need anything, just ask them.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.120
Chen,

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:14.910
Ran.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.000
-Tianye.
-Hello. You're too kind.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.630
Can you

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.910
help unload the cargo?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.120
Come, help out.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.410
So hardworking.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.870
Peng.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.390
How about it? He's reliable, right?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.570
You two bosses are here.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.170
Young Mr. He.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.810
Here are all the goods.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.440
You can check them and move them.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.910
Alright, snap to it.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.680
Copy that.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.120
Here... over to the back.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.630
I heard your child is having a birthday.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.120
I went to a lot of trouble
to scour for this jade Ruyi.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.360
I hope you like it.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.030
-Thank you, Mr. He.
-Muzhi.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.550
Muzhi.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.660
Here, look.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.870
I had someone

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.400
bid on this for me

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.170
at a Pristie's auction.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.240
Christie's.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.790
Yes.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.730
Christie's.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:06.920
Is everything done?

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.180
This is a good piece.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.109
An antique.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.200
Not bad.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:24.510
You guys

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.400
handling the shipping

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.260
have saved me a massive headache.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.750
Thank you.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.680
Recently,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.930
our gambling den

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.170
has been doing very well,
but we're short-staffed.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.510
I was thinking

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.300
if any friends
from Longwan and Zhao Village

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.320
want to make some quick money

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.270
and help out.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.160
We can work something out.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.200
Well, we're currently

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.070
quite busy with our work.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.480
Besides, Young Mr. He is managing
the gambling den very well.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.740
We won't get involved.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.770
If there's nothing else,
we'll be going now.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.240
Thank you, Mr. He.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.790
Wait.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.600
Bring Tianfei over here.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.310
Tianfei?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.050
Why is Tianfei—

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.940
Bring Tianfei over here!

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.640
Don't drag me.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:22.830
What do you mean?

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.770
What do you mean?

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.590
Peng.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.830
There was a misunderstanding.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.880
Let me explain.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.000
Why are you even explaining to them?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.110
Tianfei secretly opened
his own gambling den.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.110
You didn't know this either, right?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.640
But even so,
you don't screw over our own people.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.350
This is way too much!

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.880
Who are you calling "too much"?

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.750
Muzhi made it clear:

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.110
from now on, every gambling den
in Hanzhou belongs to the He family!

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.440
We offered you a piece of the action,
and you refused.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.480
Then you went behind our backs.
What, playing both sides now?

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.110
Who are you calling two-faced?

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.790
I'm sorry.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.350
-Buddy.
-Do you know the way home?

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.000
What's your problem?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Come on. Let's go.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.680
What...

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.110
What's your problem?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.720
Come on.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.200
Watch your head.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.070
Okay.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.090
You're just a lousy driver.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.420
Mind your own business.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.640
Stay back.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.470
What's your problem?

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.560
Are you looking for trouble?

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:11.970
Sir, please!

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.260
Don't do anything this low again.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:17.960
You...

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.080
Get lost!

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.570
You'll pay for this.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.720
You'll pay for this.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.680
You'll pay for this.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.410
You're doing this for a living?

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.510
Let's have a drink.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.490
Of course.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.070
But I need to drop someone off first.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.800
Get in my car.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.270
After that, let's grab a few drinks.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:43.800
Let's go.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.550
You'll pay.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.080
Have you visited your dad
since you got out?

00:26:58.790 --> 00:26:59.400
Yes, I did.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.140
I went to his grave
and had a chat with him.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.440
The feng shui is good.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.710
Thanks for taking care of it.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.030
The password is your

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.400
date of birth.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.790
You dressed my old man for his funeral.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.480
For that,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.460
I'll be grateful for life.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.940
You're trying to bribe me.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.240
Too late. I'm not a cop anymore.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:34.830
Here.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.890
Take it back.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.440
You just got out.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.200
You'll need money.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.240
Take it.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.000
We've waited too long
for this drink.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:51.010
Cheers.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.550
I heard

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:14.960
Hu Xiaoyue died.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.310
Yes.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.270
I was hoping to thank him
in person when I got out.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.590
He was quite young.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.320
He was a man of principle.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.960
Everyone has their own fate.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.490
It really is all about fate.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.400
Do you

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.020
know Lin?

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.030
Yes.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:38.960
Why?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.400
What do you want with him?

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.330
He owes me money.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.430
What exactly is your relationship
with Ma Jin?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.590
Don't you know that?

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.200
You were the one who caught me back then.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.750
I just did some errands for him.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.680
What's wrong with that?

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.310
I'm asking
what the relationship really is—

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.970
why did you take the fall
for him back then?

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.840
Forget it. I won't ask anymore.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.340
Now that Ma Jin has fallen,

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.780
you should be able to talk, right?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.520
Who's the person behind him?

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.830
Wait, why are you suddenly
asking about this?

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.720
He's the one who did Xu Li's case.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.520
Still dwelling on the Xu Li case?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.000
We've both served our time.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.330
Let bygones be bygones.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.550
Su.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.030
Your debts are debts, but mine aren't?

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.630
We're talking about Xu Li
and Xiaoyue's lives.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.160
This debt must be paid.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:35.790
Let's make some money

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.790
and live our lives well.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.960
Wearing a badge for a few days

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.690
doesn't make you a cop for life.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.600
It's been so many years.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.440
You think this one drinking session

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.350
is enough to talk me out of it?

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.430
I've only kowtowed
to two people in my life—

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:57.880
To my father

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.560
and to you and Hu Xiaoyue.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.430
Both of them are gone now.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.400
Who's Ma Jin?

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.030
He's fallen,

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.700
and his backers
are completely unaffected.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.820
Who do you think you are?

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.020
I'm nobody.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.480
But I really can't let this case go.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.510
Tell me,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.500
who is that person?

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.920
I honestly don't know who's behind it all.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.510
But I do know this: he's woven a web

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.030
that no one can touch. Do you understand?

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.590
Fine.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.610
Now you've got your eyes on He Gang
and He Biao, right?

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.830
What's their relationship with Ma Jin?

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.960
These two brothers together—

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.400
they're just another Ma Jin,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.190
understand?

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.640
How do you know this?

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.900
These two brothers...

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.290
If they didn't have someone backing them,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.980
could they handle Ma Jin's business?

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:03.590
Crazy.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.310
I was drinking with Su Hongbao.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.830
He got drunk and is lying at my place.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.970
He just told me something.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.270
He said that the man
behind He Biao and He Gang

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.110
is the exact same person
we've been looking for.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.590
But I feel like
he didn't finish his words.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.680
Do you need to come over?

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.160
You go ahead and drink.
I'm not coming.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.880
Then what are you planning to do?

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.480
Tomorrow I'll go
with Mr. Ye to Grand Paradise.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.030
You...

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.960
You just keep drinking with him.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.410
Alright, that's the plan then.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.630
What are you doing with that?

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.310
For self-defense.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.960
Self-defense?
You're collecting debt from a woman.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.160
Why bring a steel rod?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.310
Well, we're going to collect a debt.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.960
In case things get heated...

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.400
What's there to get heated about?
The three of us are grown men.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.600
He's laughing at you.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.190
Talk to me... Talk to me properly.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.080
Take it away.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:13.970
I'll hit you.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.880
[Si's Store]

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880
After everything I've said,

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.480
are you even listening to me?

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.720
Your husband is dead,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.960
but you still need to pay the debt.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.000
I don't have money.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.640
No money?

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.830
If you don't have money,
give me your store instead.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.890
If you don't leave,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.400
I'll call the police.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.800
You dare call the police?

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:38.650
What are you doing?

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.010
[Si's Store]

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.640
Are you okay?

00:32:59.160 --> 00:32:59.790
I'm fine.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.240
Zhou...

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.480
Zhou Sisi?

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.510
Tianye.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.650
Are you alright?

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.510
She... she's my high school classmate.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.850
Classmate, huh?

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.370
What a coincidence.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.070
Thanks.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.070
Don't mention it.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:35.440
But...

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.590
your husband...

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.440
He owed too much money

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.050
and jumped off a building.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:50.880
Was that

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.840
beaten by the debt collectors?

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.880
No.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.720
My husband was the one who beat them.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.200
You should know that your husband

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.400
owes money to He Biao.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.240
So you guys

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.410
are also here to collect debt?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.760
How did you end up
with those people?

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.449
Just a twist of fate.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.960
I remember in high school,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.290
you were a good student,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.480
but then something happened at home,
and you missed the College Entrance Exam.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.540
I dropped out and went into business.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.360
How much does he owe?

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.840
Over a million yuan.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.130
Over a million yuan?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.100
Those people just now
wanted over 200,000 yuan.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.600
That's so much money.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.900
I can't pay it back.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.110
Those people just now are nothing.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.150
Since you owe He Biao money,

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.270
he won't let you go.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.260
If we don't come,
others will.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.920
But it's so much money...

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.360
I honestly can't pay it back.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:50.960
You...

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.409
Is this place about 80-90 square meters?

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.440
Yes.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.640
With a second floor.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.980
The location is actually quite good.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.440
What if I help you
sell this shop?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.260
I've thought about it.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.710
Selling this shop

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.440
would only
get a few hundred thousand yuan.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.240
Well, how about I pool some money
together for you?

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.480
I'm sorry.

[Tired and sleepy?

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.720
I can pool some money together for you.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.450
Why are you helping me?

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.110
Look, it's not just me helping you—

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.320
someone had to do it.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.430
Once you get the money,

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.550
you can pay off your debts first,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:34.030
right?

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.530
So is it a deal or not?

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.110
If you can really help me,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.010
I trust you, Old Classmate.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.030
Okay.

[Tired and sleepy?

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.720
Well, Tianye.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.440
If I remember correctly,

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.570
weren't we supposed to collect a debt?

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.150
How come we didn't get a penny

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.280
and even
lost several hundred thousand yuan?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.230
What are you laughing at?
I've got to answer to He Biao for this.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.630
I have to help my classmate,

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.280
right?

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.190
Doesn't your wife

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.230
want to get a bigger convenience store?

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.230
I think that location is really good.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.160
Ask her about it.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.330

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.190
Good for you.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.480
What?

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.570
Okay, got it.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.090
What happened?

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.080
Mr. Wei was beaten up.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.090
They said it was someone

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.850
called Mr. Ba
from the south district who did it.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.180
And he reported
that entire batch of meat.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.030
What should we do?

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.030
We have to teach him a lesson, right?

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.950
If we're gonna cut him down,
we cut him flat.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.360
We need Uncle Limin to reach out

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.030
to Section Chief Qi from the
Administration for Industry and Commerce.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:59.070
The one who came
for the licensing last time?

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.400
We don't have any connection with him.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.760
If there's no connection,
we'll build one.

You're missing "Gang" in your life.

Now I should call you Officer Zeng.

What brings you here?

I heard that

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.340
your place was closed
for rectification recently.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.860
That was quick.
