you immediately abolished

you regarded it necessary to suppress
all opposition parties, correct?

We found it necessary
to no longer permit opposition, yeah.

01:50:36.929 --> 01:50:39.348
And you also considered it
immediately necessary

01:50:39.431 --> 01:50:41.266
to establish concentration camps?

01:50:42.309 --> 01:50:46.355

against the Communists

So, it was necessary
to erect a camp for them.

One, two, or three camps,
something like this.

01:50:54.488 --> 01:50:57.407
You also had to have certain groups

01:50:57.491 --> 01:51:00.661

01:51:01.578 --> 01:51:02.704
Certain groups?

01:51:02.788 --> 01:51:05.082
Well, for example,
if you wanted certain people killed,

01:51:05.958 --> 01:51:08.418
you had to have some organization
that would kill them.

01:51:09.711 --> 01:51:12.005
Yeah, Germany had this level
of political police

01:51:12.089 --> 01:51:13.549
as you would find in any other country.

01:51:13.632 --> 01:51:15.133
And the SA and the SS

01:51:15.217 --> 01:51:18.095
were the organizations
that carried out these orders

01:51:18.178 --> 01:51:21.139
and dealt with people on a physical level,
were they not?

01:51:21.223 --> 01:51:24.476
The SA never received orders
to kill anybody.

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:26.478
Neither did the SS. Not in my time.

01:51:26.562 --> 01:51:29.147
Beyond a certain point,
I had no influence on it.

01:51:30.107 --> 01:51:32.526
Well, the SS carried out arrests.

01:51:33.777 --> 01:51:36.697
They handled the transportation of people
to the concentration camps.

01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:38.824
Can you not recall a time

01:51:38.907 --> 01:51:40.659
when the SS began to perform the function

01:51:40.742 --> 01:51:43.287
of acting as the executor
of the Nazi Party?

01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:46.415
It would be very difficult for me
to explain to an outsider

01:51:46.498 --> 01:51:49.877
where the SS or where the Gestapo
may or may not be active.

01:51:51.253 --> 01:51:52.254
Try.

01:51:53.046 --> 01:51:57.843
Well, perhaps, as the police came more
and more into the hands of Himmler,

01:51:58.385 --> 01:51:59.887
expectations may have changed.

01:51:59.970 --> 01:52:03.056
And, of course, it is well-known
that some SS units

01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:07.769
were guarding the camps, and later,
performed some police functions.

and an SS leader was the camp commandant,

01:52:36.757 --> 01:52:39.134
then it is rational to assume

01:52:40.135 --> 01:52:44.765
