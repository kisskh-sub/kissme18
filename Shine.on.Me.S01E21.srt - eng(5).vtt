00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.780
But there's one thing on your tab

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.760
we can settle right now.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.040
What's that?

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.020
Wait a sec.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.840
Jiang Rui,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.820
come on down!
Let's go grab some hot pot.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.340
Is there even a restaurant open now?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.100
Yeah,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.540
I called ahead to check.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.220
Alright, I'll be down in a sec.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.260
I guess I'm just as hopeless.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:14.860
You're back.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.200
How's the patient?

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.580
Is everything okay?

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.800
Earlier, Xiguang's mom called and...

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.040
What's wrong?

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.400
Mom,

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.200
something bad

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.520
happened to me a while back.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.660
What happened?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.720
You can tell me.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.000
Later on,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.920
I convinced myself to let it go.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.560
And I thought I had.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.099
But these past few months,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.099
I've felt so conflicted.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.520
I kept telling myself to move on

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.200
and just follow my instincts,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.460
to let her in,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.339
to get closer to her.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.620
But every now and then,

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.580
in the middle of the night,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.140
I'd start questioning myself:

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.840
"How can you forget that so easily?"

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:46.800
But today,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.840
everything changed.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:51.900
Lin Yusen!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.720
I don't think

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.920
I'll ever have to suffer
through that again.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.540
I finally feel whole.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:15.920
I'm not quite sure

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.800
what you're talking about,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.040
but I'm happy for you.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.540
And I think there might have been
some misunderstandings.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.160
When our friends

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.040
were playing messenger for us,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.160
maybe things
didn't get passed along quite right.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.060
I was avoiding it before,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.240
so I never asked.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.200
But I think

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:40.940
I need to find out

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.780
exactly what happened.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.060
Vincent.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.260
I didn't expect you to...

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.740
Happy...

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.460
Chinese New Year.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.380
Jiaqi,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.420
where are you right now?

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.260
Is it a good time to talk?

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.140
Yeah...

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.500
I'm abroad with some friends.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.260
We're out at sea.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:25.740
Forget it.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.340
Just let me know when you're back.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.180
I'll swing by and see you.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.380
I have something to ask you.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.560
Urgent?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.040
Important?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.220
It's okay.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.320
It's not that pressing.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.840
And it's not that big of a deal anymore.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.340
We were supposed to be having
a great time on this trip.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.340
I never imagined
things would end up like this.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.520
Kevin is in the ICU now,

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.940
and there's nothing we can do.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.180
HR said

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.960
they'll go into the office tomorrow
to pull his files

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.280
and get in touch with his parents.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.100
I have Kevin's phone with me.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.340
If his parents call,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.680
I can pick up and let them know.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.900
But

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.760
I remember them
being out of the country.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.320
I doubt they'll be able

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.200
to make it back anytime soon.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.340
You guys should head back

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:20.940
to Shanghai tomorrow as planned.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.240
There's no point in everyone

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.800
staying here.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.540
I'll stay behind to look after him.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.040
You're staying here alone?

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.320
Yeah.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.540
I've already cleared it

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.700
with my family and Mr. Song.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.500
I'll wait until Kevin's parents arrive.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.140
Plus, I can help

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.860
with the legwork

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.300
for his transfer back to Shanghai.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.800
Are you sure?

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.400
It doesn't feel right for us
to just leave.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.040
Kevin is in the ICU,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.300
so there's no point in us staying here.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.460
Plus, the company needs

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.140
someone back at the office.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.620
I've got experience

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.660
looking after patients.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.140
This trip to Changbai Mountain

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.920
was my idea anyway,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.280
so it's only right that I do a bit more.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.220
It's settled then.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.760
You guys head back to Shanghai tomorrow,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.440
and I'll pack my things
and move into the town.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.140
Let's finish up and get back.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.700
Can you take Kevin's suitcase back

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.600
with you tomorrow?

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.220
I'll take these to the hospital.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.080
I'm going to go back now

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.680
and pack my own things.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.940
Dang it, Mia.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.360
I think I'm really falling for him.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.400
Please,
like it wasn't incredibly obvious?

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.160
No, this is different.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.160
Before today,

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.960
it was just about his looks

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.560
and how capable he is.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.820
But now,

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.080
I've seen

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:02.940
he's genuinely kind,

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.280
and he actually steps up.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.560
I know in this day and age,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.380
calling someone "kind" sounds
a little cheesy.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.640
But I still feel like

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.760
it's the rarest thing
you can find in a person.

She's got her boyfriend with her.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.920
And he's hot.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.480
But

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800
I don't think they look like a couple.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.200
Look at other couples.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.440
They're all hand-in-hand,

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.940
like they're literally attached
at the hip.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:38.780

your student's cousin.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.460
He looks so slick out there.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.040
Seems like a total pro.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.820
Chasing who?

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.060
The one chasing your student's cousin.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.660
Excuse me, do you happen to
have an umbrella?

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.820

[Sugar]

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.420
That looks so good.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.420
I found those in the fridge

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.420
and figured I'd whip something up.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.040
Well,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.160
if the fridge
magically refills itself every day,

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.260
would you keep "whipping something up"

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:39.920
like this?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.000
Yes.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.820
Eating hotel food all the time isn't...

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.440
It's not right for me
to just tag along and eat your food.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.300
Xu,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.820
you're so impressive.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.440
When Ms. Zhang is away,

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.180
we can finally have

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.380
some decent, home-cooked meals.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.060
Hotel food is way too expensive,
and the hygiene is questionable.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.760
It even messed up Xiguang's stomach.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.780
You've got something
on your face. Let me see.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.920
Why would you tell him

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.140
about my stomach issues?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.680
Is that a secret?

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.980
Of course it is.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.380
You're ruining my image.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.000
Xu found out ages ago.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.300
So, what exactly is going on

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.040
between you and Lin Yusen?

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.860
If I were you,

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.560
I'd just ask her out.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.380
No.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.720
When they walked past us just now,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.360
I should have

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:32.890
Grandpa, Mr. Li,

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.570
I'll head out now.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.130
Alright.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.230
Drive safe.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:42.810
I've dug into it.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.990
The leak came from Bokai's wife's side.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.870
Her relatives in Changbai Mountain

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:48.590
ran into Weiai,

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:51.450
and they made sure
the news got back to you.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.670
I figured as much.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.170
After all these years,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.510
they still haven't learned a thing,
have they?

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.670
Always relying
on the same old cheap tricks.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.070
Weiai has been away for so long,

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.310
yet they're still so threatened by her

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:15.170
that they come to me to stir the pot.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.590
I bet they're hoping

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.010
Weiai won't get a single penny
after I kick the bucket.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.170
Maybe

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.090
they just wanted you to know

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.730
that Weiai is doing okay.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.550
Do you actually believe that?

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.310
Honestly, I've lost track
of how long it's been

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.770
since I last saw her.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.550
In the blink of an eye,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.470
Yusen's all grown up.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.090
How could she be so heartless

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.310
to her dad

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.510
and her son?

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.110
In Weiai's heart,

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.330
the one she blames most

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.250
is probably herself.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.790
If she truly hated you,

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.610
she wouldn't have let Yusen

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.410
stay in touch with you all these years.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.230
I need a moment to myself.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.150
You got quite worked up a few days ago,

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.290
and your heart started acting up.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:17.350
It would be best

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.190
if you went back inside now.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.890
And about the banquet early next month,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:23.010
do you think

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.830
we should keep the guest list small?

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.150
I'm worried it might be

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.990
too much of a strain on you.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.530
It's fine.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:33.590
Let's stick to the plan.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.070
I know

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:37.310
my own limits.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.150
Are you still going

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.170
with Xingjie for the banquet?

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.310
Sometimes,

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.370
it's only when you're at the top

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:51.870
that you can see people's true colors.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.010
When someone thinks they've already won,

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.670
how they act then

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.050
is who they really are.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.170
Was it you who told Dad

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.270
about Weiai coming back?

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.810
That was so unnecessary.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:21.790
Dad's already decided to groom Xingjie

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:22.730
as his successor.

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.050
Why are you still messing around

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:24.550
with these little tricks?

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.390
Did you honestly think
you could keep it from him?

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.410
If you had been more capable,

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:30.530
I wouldn't have had to

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:31.410
resort to these little tricks

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.190
20 years ago.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.050
A woman only resorts to scheming

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:35.650
when her man is useless.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.090
Unbelievable.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:40.690
Where are you going?

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:42.390
Chinese New Year isn't even over yet,

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:43.390
and you already can't sit still?

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:44.910
Nie Chengyuan is in Shanghai.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.190
I'm going to see him.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.170
Why the long face?

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.130
Don't get me started. Just family drama.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.690
I heard your dad

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.610
has been keeping Xingjie
by his side lately,

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.350
showing him the ropes personally.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.070
I thought you'd be

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.650
on cloud nine right now.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.350
It was supposed to be a done deal,

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.730
but Yao Shu just had to

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:20.350
stir the pot.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:21.430
I called her out on it,

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:22.550
and now she's giving me attitude.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.310
If it weren't for the fact
that her brothers

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.090
are still somewhat useful...

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:26.830
What about you?

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:28.810
Chinese New Year is barely over.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:30.870
What brings you to Shanghai?

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.270
Got bored of Wuxi,

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:35.350
so I brought the ladies here
for a change of pace.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:37.690
They're shopping at the mall.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:38.910
I didn't have the patience
to follow them around.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:42.290
Still with that first love of yours?

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:44.610
At your age,

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:45.510
you're still acting this clingy?

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.730
You're not planning to bring her

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:48.850
to my dad's birthday banquet, are you?

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.670
I'm not that foolish.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:54.010
That's good.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.510
Otherwise,
Yao Shu will start nagging again

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.370
about me hanging out
with a bad influence.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.190
She didn't complain
when I was helping you

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.890
make money.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.090
Now that she's the mother of the heir,

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.250
she's really high and mighty, isn't she?

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.330
I don't get it.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.410
She and Jiang Yun

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:11.470
aren't really close either.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.170
I heard they're inviting a lot of people

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.090
to the banquet.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.830
Your dad usually keeps a low profile.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.510
Why all the fanfare?

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:22.890
Is he planning to announce Xingjie

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:23.410
as the successor?
