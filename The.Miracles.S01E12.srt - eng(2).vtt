WEBVTT

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.020
World-class technology

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.020
Not in Europe or America, not in Japan or Korea

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.939
It's precisely hidden right beside us

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.659
Our company, after going public

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.340
In the three years

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.060
Acquired five small and micro enterprises

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.420
These companies

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.819
Have all developed very well

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:19.980
Your product

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.459
We have conducted a rigorous evaluation

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:23.620
We look forward to cooperating with you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.939
If the signing goes smoothly

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.019
You two directors

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.140
Next month

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:34.859
You can achieve financial freedom

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.500
I think, Director Chen

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:43.980
I feel this matter

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.140
Is a bit too sudden

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.379
Please give us a few days

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:48.780
To consider it carefully, okay?

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.939
That's right

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.260
It's a two-way selection

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.420
After all, there are many investors

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.620
Who are optimistic about us

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:56.420
Right

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.620
Alright then

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.260
Time will prove our sincerity

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.140
So

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.180
Later

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.980
I'll send the contract for you two to review

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.060
If you have any questions

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.219
Contact me anytime

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.340
In life

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.259
The most important thing is

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.180
To be happy

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.460
Money or no money

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:17.379
It doesn't matter

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.939
But if I sign the contract

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.939
And buy that place in Shenzhen Bay

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:21.500
Sir

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.219
Will you live there or not?

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:24.539
Of course

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:25.819
You get one unit, I get one

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.620
Right across the hall

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900
Then bring your daddy and mommy

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.419
Your brother and sister

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.979
And bring them all over

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.340
What's most important for a family?

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.340
To be all together

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.139
Yeah

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:40.979
Cheers, cheers

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.740
Jokes aside

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.139
Let me be blunt first

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.180
Acquiring the company is fine

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.539
But the product R&D direction

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.300
Must remain in

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.939
Our own hands

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:53.659
Otherwise

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.740
Everything is off the table

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:55.819
Of course

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.180
Don't forget our original aspiration

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.979
Tell me

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.379
We two aren't

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.180
Really about to succeed, are we?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.060
Yeah

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.740
You're speaking so softly

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.460
Boss, I can't hear you

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.340
I said

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.139
Yeah

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.259
Yeah

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:15.900
Yeah

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.379
Yeah

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.740
Party A holds dominant rights

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.659
Over future product R&D direction

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.020
What does this mean?

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:44.819
Simply put

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.699
We are acquiring you

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.139
To maximize profits

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.020
Xiaoyu

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.139
Boss

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.580
You knew they had

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.020
This additional clause, didn't you?

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.139
Although we are very grateful to you

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.180
For introducing this company

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.060
I think you still

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.860
Don't understand us

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.180
If we sell our ideals

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.659
For this bit of money

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.740
That would be utterly unworthy of

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.699
Our parents who raised us

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.259
And even more unworthy of ourselves

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.139
Jiawen's father has bone cancer

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.540
Acquiring the company is fine

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.860
But the product R&D direction

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.459
Must remain in our own hands

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.060
Otherwise, everything is off the table

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.060
Dad said you're starting a business

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.420
Told me not to bother you

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.860
But since you've succeeded now

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.259
I'll tell you

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:57.740
Dad, he

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.819
Has bone cancer

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:29.860
So frustrating

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.540
I've been down on my luck for three years

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:42.819
Just waiting for one chance

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.699
To prove myself

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:44.459
Not to prove to others

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:45.620
How amazing I am

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.060
Datou Wen

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:07.019
Brought you

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:07.939
Your favorite roast meats

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.980
Where are you?

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:16.740
Datou Wen

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.180
Xiaoyu

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.300
By the time you read this letter,

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.100
I will have already gone home to take care of Daddy.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.819
I've transferred my share of the equity.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.939
First, I want to say I'm sorry.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.620
You treated me like a brother,

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:43.379
but I let you down.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.459
I know

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.139
this time

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.699
we were truly about to succeed.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:51.980
Yet I fell down

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.740
just before the dawn of victory.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.620
Looking at it this way,

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.699
I really am a bit like Brother Ma.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.259
Last night,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.939
I kept lying to myself,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.819
telling myself Xiaoyu would surely understand.

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:08.620
But when I woke up this morning

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.939
and looked at that contract,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.500
I suddenly felt

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.500
I didn't even recognize myself anymore.

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:19.300
Our original aspiration

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:21.060
has been lost by me.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.420
I have no face left to see you again.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:26.060
You are my best brother,

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:27.100
the person in this life

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.939
I least wanted to owe.

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:30.740
This time, I owe you.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:32.300
If there's a chance,

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:33.740
I would rather

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.980
spend my entire life

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.980
making it up to you.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:37.459
All I have left now

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.620
is a single

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.139
"I'm sorry."

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.100
If you succeed in the future,

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:44.500
I will be proud of you.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.180
If you face setbacks,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.860
I will always support you.

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.339
That glimmer of light...

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:52.819
Don't let it go out.

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:11.019
To further improve surgical safety,

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:12.699
we must reduce the sensor's size

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:13.939
by another ten percent.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.420
But if we do that,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.180
the original structure and decoupling algorithm

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:17.939
will both become ineffective.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.259
Previously, this part

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:22.100
was all handled by Brother Wen.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.300
Director Hu,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.420
someone is here to see you.

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:27.100
Reject the interview.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.779
Didn't I already say?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.740
It seems to be a delivery person.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.819
He has a cup of milk tea.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.019
He says if you don't sign for it personally,

00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:32.980
he won't leave.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.700
Awen,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.460
I will wait for you forever.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.980
The company's door is always open for you.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.299
How is your father's health?

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.059
After he had an operation,

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:29.419
it's stable now.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.340
I see. Stable is good.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.500
How have you been?

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:40.980
Good.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.620
What about you?

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:48.940
So free,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.940
you have time to deliver milk tea?

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:53.620
Free? Yeah.

00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:55.700
Free enough to grow mold.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.460
So,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.379
I thought I'd come work for you.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.860
To pay you back.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.980
Pay back what money?

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.740
That was the company's dividend.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.779
This is for you.

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:19.539
Your favorite:

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:20.940
iced yuanyang.

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:25.779
Thanks.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.500
I should be the one thanking you.

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:32.860
Also, my dad had surgery.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.100
Actually, the one used

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:41.179
was your company's sensor.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.580
I want to say

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.980
it's great, really impressive.

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:54.779
Yours, mine...

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.100
Did I ever kick you out back then?

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.059
Did I agree to your resignation?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:03.860
Do you have any idea

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.139
I waited for you for three years?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.460
What did you tell me before?

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.860
You said, "Brothers carry burdens together."

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.860
You said you needed to take care of your family,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.059
needed money, had to sign the contract...

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.940
I didn't blame you.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.340
Why didn't you tell me face to face?

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.059
It was you who said "brothers carry burdens together."

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.779
"Brothers carry burdens together."

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.460
You said it!

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:22.860
If we're brothers,

00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:24.340
we carry it together.

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:29.580
In your letter, you said...

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:32.700
you said to guard that glimmer of light.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.179
I guarded it. What about you?

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.379
Do you still believe in brotherhood?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.100
Do you still believe

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.580
we can pull off something big together?

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:07.139
The decoupling algorithm...

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:10.860
Can you still handle it?

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.580
My company needs a partner.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.940
I... I think I can.

00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:30.980
You're speaking so softly, I can't hear you.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.940
Boss,

00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:37.700
what I just said was,

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:40.700
"I can handle it!"

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:47.460
Good.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.460
Welcome home.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.340
Director Chen.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.659
Thank you.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.419
Thank you.

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:06.059
Welcome back.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.779
Some say

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.659
Shenzhen is a city of miracles.

00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:38.179
But I think

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.659
the real miracle

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:40.860
is glimmers of light like ours.

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:42.299
Countless glimmers,

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.700
no matter how faint,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.220
as long as they gather together,

00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:47.820
are enough to light up the entire city.
