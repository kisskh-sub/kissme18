[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.900
[Episode 17]

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.039
But you must tell me everything

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.039
that happened here in detail—

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.479
Tell us.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:43.920
D...

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.150
Don't hide anything.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.310
I don't dare hide anything.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:57.320
Let's go.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.220
They said

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.680
if I brought you here,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770
they would play shuttlecock with me.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.830
I...

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.060
just wanted someone
to play shuttlecock with me.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.960
You really like playing shuttlecock
this much?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.430
Yes.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.500
To be honest with you,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.810
before now,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.300
we've never actually seen
the Taotie with our own eyes.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.680
It's just that after people
went into the mountains,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.370
they never came back out.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.310
And when we found the bodies,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.630
they were all missing arms or legs.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.480
So,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.360
we just said it was the Taotie's doing.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.030
You know, it's strange.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.079
In recent years,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.190
the Taotie has been appearing frequently

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.050
and often comes into the village.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.470
Then how do you determine

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.130
that it's the Taotie who's hurting people?

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.800
Everyone knows there's a Taotie

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.080
on Mount Qiansui.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.540
Besides the Taotie,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.030
what else could it be?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.340
The Taotie has returned!

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.680
Zixiu, you go home.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.579
Go, go, go.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.710
Go, go, go.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.190
Hurry!

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.430
Catch the demon!

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.560
Catch the demon!

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.140
After it!

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.910
Where is it?

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.570
Over there!

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520
Don't let it escape!

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.580
-Here!
-It's here!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.560
Catch the demon!

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.160
Chase it!

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.459
Over there!

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.560
Don't let it get away!

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.120
Hurry up!

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.950
Where's the demon?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.510
Quick!

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.490
Catch the demon!

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.830
It's here!

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.680
Catch the demon!

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.310
Demon, you can't escape!

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.110
Stop!

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.680
I'm going to kill it

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.600
to avenge Ya.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.360
Before we clarify everything,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360
don't harm the innocent.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.490
Who else could it be?

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.190
We already captured it.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.120
Why not kill it?

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.920
It has taken human lives,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.950
yet you protect it.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.070
What are your intentions?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.400
We agreed on it already.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.270
We have no more silver
to give to the officials.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.930
Move aside!

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.160
Since it's already subdued,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.680
why not get to the bottom of this first?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.390
Kill it! Kill it!

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.160
It's a demon!

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.330
Kill it!

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.510
Kill it!

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.860
Kill it! Kill it!

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.920
Kill it! Kill it!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.750
Get out of the way!

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.160
Yes, kill it!

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.390
Kill it.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.190
Kill it!

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.390
Kill it.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.120
Kill it!

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.920
Kill it!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.800
Silence!

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.190
Lock it up first.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.680
We'll decide after the investigation.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.720
Leader,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.430
what do you think?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.000
We will

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.560
follow your orders, My Lord.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.510
I know

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.490
you don't want to hurt anyone.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.190
If you really wanted to fight,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.790
neither we nor the villagers

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.270
could stop you.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.750
Don't be afraid.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.190
I need to remove

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.160
this arrow

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.920
and apply medicine, okay?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.659
That way, your wound can heal.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.270
It might hurt a bit.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.190
Try to bear it.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.360
What's wrong?

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.360
It's nothing.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.360
Get out.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.750
Get out!

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.270
It's fine.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.190
I need to remove your outer robe now

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.450
to apply the medicine.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.560
Okay, okay.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.560
I won't remove it.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.750
I'll just apply it like this.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.010
This is healing salve.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.680
Why does it look somewhat familiar

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.020
yet different?

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.000
That's Little Leaf,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
a spirit herb.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.830
Don't talk nonsense.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.920
I'm no spirit herb.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.590
I'm a super powerful great demon!

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.490
You understand human speech.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.960
Let me ask you,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.409
are you responsible
for the villagers' deaths?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.280
Then let me ask you in a different way.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.060
You've been coming
to the village repeatedly.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.920
Are you looking for something?

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.070
Li.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.610
I'd like to borrow something from you.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.650
What do you want?

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.040
Here,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.420
take a look at this.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.600
Do you recognize it?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.840
Li says this belonged to his wife.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.280
It's the one!

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.150
That's it!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.880
Look at those eyes!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.270
I've seen those eyes before.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.730
They're exactly
like the ones in the forest.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.790
Coming!

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.730
Keep it down.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.650
This Taotie
hasn't hurt anyone in my family,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.620
nor damaged my house or fields.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.830
Why are you causing trouble with Li?

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:14.910
Help!

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.670
Help me!

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.270
Leader, help us!

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.990
The dead has really come back to life?

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.810
Fire! Hurry to put it out!

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.390
Go quickly!

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.490
Li, come on!

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.120
Hurry!

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.730
This way!

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.220
There's a fire! Quick!

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.390
Has another demon entered the village?

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.920
It has nothing to do with me.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.240
Give me your blade.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.690
No way.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.480
What if the Taotie escapes?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
I'll stay here and watch.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.600
It's still chained up.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.870
Don't worry, it can't escape.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.320
Help! Help!

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.550
Help me!

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.600
Help!

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.980
Take care of yourself.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.960
Help me!

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.840
I don't want to die!

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.030
Help!

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.480
As if I need you to tell me that.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.610
Taking care of people is what I do best.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.430
Help me!

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.440
Get up.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.840
Help me!

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.200
Help me!

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.920
Help me!

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.490
Help! Help me!

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.360
Help me!

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.520
Save me! Help me quickly!

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.910
Save me quickly! Help me!

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:06.530
Get up now.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.840
Thank you, My Lord.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.900
Thank you, My Lord.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.220
How many corpses are there in total?

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.510
How would I know?

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.510
It seems like all the bodies

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.440
from the graveyard have appeared.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.750
Help me!

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.200
Help me!

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.270
Help me!

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.960
Help me!

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.720
Help me!

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.130
Help me!

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.000
Help!

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.000
Help!

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.960
Xiao Yao,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.510
save me!

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.320
Help!

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.440
Save me!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.010
Alright, alright.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.810
I'll go check.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.320
Xiao Yao, save me!

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.080
Save me!

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.870
Behind you!

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.520
Thank you.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.020
Move aside!

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.940
We caught it
but weren't allowed to kill it.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.200
Now it's escaped again.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.530
Bunch of useless fools.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.870
Watch your mouth.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.200
It has never harmed anyone

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.530
and it just saved us now.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.100
Saved you?

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:58.940
This demon

00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:59.910
can break free from chains

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.150
and tear those corpses apart.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.270
You say it won't harm people?

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.550
Use your brain.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.720
No matter how strong it is,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.080
it only used that strength to save people.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.510
If it had used that power against you,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.370
do you think you'd still be alive?

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.480
I'm done arguing with you.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.200
Who's coming with me to catch the Taotie?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.600
Li, Xiao Yao has a point.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.720
After tonight's ordeal,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.410
if you go back into the mountains
to hunt the demon,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.870
you'll likely not return.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.240
Leader,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.010
my talismans failed to stop the demon.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.010
I am responsible.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.170
I'll go with him.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.530
My Lord, you cannot go.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.300
My Lord,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.240
tonight's situation

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.320
is something we've never seen before.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.000
If the demon comes back

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.310
we certainly won't be able to resist.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.250
Please, My Lord,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.800
stay with us

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.860
to guard this village

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.960
and protect the women,
children, and elderly.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.170
My Lord.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.480
I'll go check.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.280
Xiao Yao.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.660
Don't worry.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.670
That demon doesn't seem evil to me.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.840
It actually seems quite humane.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.000
If Li encounters it,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.270
someone will surely get hurt.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.670
We can't let that happen.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.380
Those zombies just now
had no demonic power.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.000
Their minds were confused too.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.930
They must have been
cursed by someone to harm people.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.670
I will set up

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.750
a formation around the village.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.200
If demons attack again,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.860
we'll be warned immediately.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.710
Well, My Lord,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.840
how can we help?

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.660
Tell the villagers to go home and rest.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.990
I can handle this alone.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.510
Then...

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.700
Thank you, My Lord.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.970
Thank you, My Lord.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.820
Let's go.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.200
What's this?

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.670
How come I suddenly can't see clearly?

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.440
Why is there so much fog?

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.500
What's happening?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.960
Greetings, My Lord.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.110
Weren't you at the celestial mountain?

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.610
Those official ladies...

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.440
My Lord,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.880
we received reports from the government

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.360
that the Mount Qiansui area

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.910
has been troubled
by demons for a long time.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.110
That's why we rushed here without rest.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.970
I came for the same reason.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.400
Since that's the case,

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.120
I'll trouble all of you

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.410
to help me protect the people here.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.220
As you command.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.220
-As you command!
-As you command!

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.930
Thank you for your help,

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.070
Commander Ji.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.800
Don't step on the formation!

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.030
Alright.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.040
Kneel down!

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.770
Come, sir.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.570
Get up quickly.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.360
Commander Ji,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.870
you're quite imperious.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.350
I wouldn't dare.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.110
Put away your blades!

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.290
This village is already impoverished.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.079
None of you

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.819
are to disturb the villagers.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.400
Yes.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.640
Rise up now.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720
-Get up.
-My Lord,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.829
we work for the court

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.089
and receive court salaries.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.240
Why bother associating
with these peasants?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.550
If you want to play the humble official,

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.069
you can do that back in the capital.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.400
In this barren place,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.040
who are you performing for?

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.980
Commander Ji,

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.800
without the common people,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.530
there would be no court.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.340
Without the people's taxes,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.980
where would our salaries come from?

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.560
You're absolutely right, My Lord.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.340
Feiyu Guards, attention!

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.010
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.950
Split into four teams

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.800
and set up defensive formations
around the village.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.260
Take over patrol duties
from the villagers.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.110
If any great demon appears,

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.280
protect the villagers

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.280
with all your might.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.270
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.000
Let's go.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.720
Go.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.270
My Lord,

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.910
there's something I don't understand.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:44.590
Speak.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.830
Your demon-slaying blade

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.450
that never left your side before,
even while sleeping...

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.460
where is it now?

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.920
My Lord, since your return
from the celestial mountain,

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.960
did the immortals provide any guidance

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.090
about the location of the Yuli Spring?

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.930
You must have found the Yuli Spring water

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.940
and only need to present it
to the emperor in the capital.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.140
I offer my congratulations in advance.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.750
If you receive promotions and titles,

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.470
please look out for me.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.810
Thank you in advance.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.550
I haven't found the Yuli Spring.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.390
But there's an extraordinarily powerful
great demon nearby.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.670
If we can eliminate it,

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.280
you can have all the credit.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.930
You probably know better than me

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.650
what the emperor wants.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.100
I'm overstepping,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.250
but I just want to
remind you of something.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.830
If you return to the capital alone

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.480
without the Yuli Spring water

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.050
to gain the emperor's protection,

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.850
those officials' daughters
that you took away...

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.480
The powerful families in the capital

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.790
won't let you off easily.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.440
It's not your place

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.830
to lecture me.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.000
I'm only concerned

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.900
for your welfare.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.640
Water.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.310
Water.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.720
Li.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:43.940
Li?

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.330
Demon King.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.940
Mr. Ji, you're fashionably late.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.480
And you arranged to meet me

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.480
in such a remote and strange place.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.030
Why so cautious?

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.970
You jest, My Lord.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.330
Your power is extraordinary.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.830
I am just a mere human.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.350
I need to rely on you.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.400
Mr. Ji, since you are so cautious,

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.360
if someone ruins our plans,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.230
what shall we do?

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.310
My Lord, please don't blame me.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.460
Bingzhu's arrival

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.090
was unexpected to me as well.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.920
He only said he heard about a great demon

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.180
and came to capture it.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.790
But

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.380
his demon-slaying blade is missing.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.040
Something serious must have happened.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.210
Did he find the Yuli Spring?

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.240
I'm certain

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.980
he didn't find it.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.390
With his sudden arrival,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.970
should we continue

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.110
our plan?

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.970
Of course not.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.610
His appearance

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.480
is unexpected, but...

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.820
it is heaven-sent.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.410
What do you mean?

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.140
This is the Yuli Spring

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.240
that Master Bingzhu obtained
at the cost of his life.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.920
I will do my utmost

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.390
to present it to His Majesty.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.900
Didn't you say he didn't find Yuli Spring?

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.040
Lord Heiwu,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.420
everyone has heard of
the Yuli Spring water,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.900
but no one has ever seen it.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:26.940
In other words,

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.330
as long as drinking it doesn't kill you,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.350
it can all be called the Yuli Spring.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.740
This is what Master Bingzhu received

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.000
in exchanged for his life.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.860
Then, Mr. Ji, what do you want?

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.960
What I want

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.190
is only to
wholeheartedly serve you, Demon King.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.850
You need not worry about
the Feiyu Guard slaughtering demons again.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.960
You only need to provide us with some

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.030
minor demons that haven't
gone through the test yet.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.820
Demon Slayer, you're quite calculating.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.420
I fear one day

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.780
you'll scheme against me too.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.200
I wouldn't dare.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.280
We are all your soldiers.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.510
The Feiyu Guard will

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.710
serve the Demon King with all our might.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.010
Who is it?

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.480
Immortal!

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.510
An immortal has come!

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.670
Why did you come down from Mount Qiansui?

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.970
No need for such formality.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.110
Immortal!

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.450
I heard about the village's suffering

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.610
and that many people have fallen ill.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.490
I've brought the Yuli Spring
down the mountain

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.090
to help relieve your suffering.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.640
Thank you, Immortal.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.060
You are so merciful!

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.280
Quickly show the way.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.190
Immortal,

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.950
this way please.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.770
To the village, please.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.770
This way, please.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.650
You really are Ya.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.750
No!

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.680
Li,

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.920
she is your wife, Ya.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:49.710
If you keep talking nonsense,

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.890
I'll cut you down too.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.420
What I'm saying is all true.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.010
She wasn't eaten by demons.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.480
She probably became like this

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.940
because she was poisoned.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:58.850
Look,

00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.830
what is this?

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.520
Impossible.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.170
Tell me.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.390
Did you kill Ya

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.240
and steal the jade pendant?

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.780
Tell me, did you kill her?

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.550
Speak!

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.260
Li!

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.800
You...

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.050
You can't keep running away
from this anymore.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.250
She is Ya.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.360
Impossible!

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.640
Impossible!

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.600
Ya was the most beautiful

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.850
and kind-hearted woman in the world.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.060
She's still kind. That hasn't changed.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.720
Look at the herbs on your arm.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.030
Think about it.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.790
Why does she always go to the village,

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.120
yet never hurts anyone?

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.960
Why are you the one

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.050
who sees her first
whenever she visits the village?

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:17.940
Why is it that every time
you chase and hurt her,

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.860
she never harms you in return,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.270
and only runs away?

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.590
It's all my fault.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.030
My Lord,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.640
we've been patrolling
all village entrances

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.440
but found no trace of any demons.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:01.960
There's a demon!

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
A demon is coming!

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.030
Demon!

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.830
-Run!
-Run!

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.880
Zixiu.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.520
What's wrong?

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.040
I saw a demon.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.680
What did this demon look like?

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.880
He wore a big black robe,

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.880
had a pale face,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.070
and was not very tall.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.720
The person talking to him

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.720
just now...

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.400
Zixiu.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.980
Don't point like that.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.270
The Taotie has returned!

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.850
The Taotie is back!

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.170
Feiyu Guards,

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.940
Eight Sun Formation!

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.750
Stop!

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.770
She's not a demon.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.150
She's Ya.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.240
Ya?

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.740
I...

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.810
It's all my fault.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:26.650
All my fault.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.340
I should have realized sooner.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.460
Every day,

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.860
you snuck into the village at night

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.630
just to see me.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.750
When I stabbed you,

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.910
there were tears in your eyes.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.880
Every time I returned
from hunting in the mountains,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.230
empty-handed,

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:46.680
there would always be prey

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.680
appearing on my path home.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.080
I'm so stupid.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.420
I didn't hear
what you were trying to tell me.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.800
Ya,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.310
do you hate me?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.670
You did so much and waited so long,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.140
yet I didn't recognize you.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.400
I'm so stupid. I deserve to die.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.050
I've caused you so much suffering.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.380
I miss you.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.400
Xiao Yao,

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.910
why are you crying?

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.500
Ya can never return to her original form.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.090
What are you thinking of doing?

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.060
I'm telling you,

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.610
don't even think about it.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.960
The real Taotie hasn't been found yet.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.650
I still need my strength
to protect your life.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.110
You have a way
to turn her back to her original form?

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.100
I'm telling you,

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.310
I won't agree to it no matter what.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.040
Little Leaf,

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.750
please.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.930
I know I'm dumb.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.020
I didn't study techniques properly.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.400
My power is too weak.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.350
Now, I want to save someone

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.510
but have no way to do it.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.440
Don't cry anymore.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.400
Alright, alright.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.560
I'll do it. I'll do it, alright?

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.810
But I must tell you,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.680
my technique

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.690
can only turn her back for one hour.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.000
After using the technique,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.310
I'll turn into a straw bracele.t

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.240
If you face danger again,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.300
-you can only rely on yourself.
-Okay. Change quickly.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:37.560
Thank you.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.880
Immortal, please bless us.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.630
Immortal, please bless us.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.590
Bring us fortune and ward off disaster!

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.630
Immortal, please bless us.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.000
Bring us fortune and ward off disaster!

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.490
Do not panic, everyone.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.590
I have come here

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.280
to relieve your suffering.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.470
Drink the Yuli Spring water
from my bottle.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.030
You will surely

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.350
be cured of all illnesses

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.960
and gain immortality.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.550
-Thank you, Immortal.
-Thank you, Immortal.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.240
Ya!

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:34.660
Zixiu?

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.310
You're finally back!

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.670
Where are the other villagers?

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.670
A demon entered the village

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.130
and gathered everyone.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:42.630
Follow me.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.260
Don't drink it!

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:50.990
Don't drink!

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:52.140
Don't!

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.380
This...

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.590
He's not an Immortal.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.710
He's a demon!

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.230
Demon?

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.910
I became a demon after drinking his water!

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.410
You'll turn into a demon if you drink it.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:06.600
What's going on?

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.880
Demon,

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.250
die!

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.780
Without the demon-slaying blade,

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.170
you think you can kill me?

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.890
The Feiyu Guard's reputation
extends far and wide,

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.980
and it's not just because of this blade.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.110
Form the formation!

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.940
What's happening?

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.520
My Lord, I'm sorry,

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.530
but following you leads nowhere.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.440
Everyone here today

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:49.580
must die.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.420
With me here,

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.460
you lowly Heiwu, kneel down!

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.050
You use the demon race's name

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.800
to slaughter innocent people.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.670
Truly despicable!

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:04.970
You...

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:08.610
We meet again.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.280
Mount Qiansui,

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.400
is remote and isolated,

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.330
surrounded by mountains and rivers.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.720
Troublemakers run rampant,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.580
disrespecting imperial orders,

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:30.060
always seeking violence.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.130
Today,

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.390
you even conspire with a demoness
and raise mythical beasts,

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.830
causing havoc everywhere.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:36.760
The Feiyu Guard,

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.420
representing Tiansheng Kingdom's
righteous army,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.420
has come here

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.740
to execute traitors

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.030
and eliminate future threats.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.800
I'll deal with

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:49.920
this demoness myself.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.240
Little Leaf.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.920
Little Leaf.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.230
Hong Ye.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.700
Hong Ye!

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.580
If you don't come soon,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:24.580
I'll have to strangle her.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.920
This neck feels so familiar.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:35.210
Why isn't your Hong Ye
coming to save you today?

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.340
Let's fight them!

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:45.300
Li!

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:57.710
Villains!

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.270
You're all villains!

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.510
Xiao Yao!

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:44.520
Zixiu!

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.920
Zixiu!

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.230
Zixiu!

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.360
Zixiu!

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.680
Xiao Yao.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:02.640
Zixiu.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.150
Zixiu.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.150
Zixiu.
