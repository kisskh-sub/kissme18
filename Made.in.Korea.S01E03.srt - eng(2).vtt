WEBVTT

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:11.992
It is time for the flag-lowering ceremony.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.495
Please face the flag with respect.

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.205
I bet you're wondering,

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:20.334
"What is this, some kind of prank?"

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.961
This is what they called
the flag-lowering ceremony.

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.255
Our dear Mr. President's own invention.

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:27.549
And that wasn't all.

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:31.470
After midnight, you couldn't even
be out on the streets.

00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:34.306
It was to crack down on decadent trends

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.892
that threatened public morals
and order or whatever.

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:38.935
SEX INDUSTRY

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.230
Men were banned
from growing sideburns over their ears,

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:47.361
and women in miniskirts were punished
for indecent exposure.

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:50.572
Curfews.

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:51.823
No assemblies.

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:53.116
No protests.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.078
No long hair and no miniskirts, either.

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:57.454
TO RESTORE SOCIAL DISCIPLINE

00:00:57.537 --> 00:00:58.789
IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION

00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:02.793
People were monitored, raided,
beaten, and killed.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.338
KIM DAEJUNG RETURNED HOME

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.257
If they could go
after heavyweight opposition politicians,

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:11.677
imagine what they did to ordinary people.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.805
We were basically treated
like cattle, like pigs.

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:18.934
But the very ones leading the crackdowns?

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:20.602
They lived above every ban.

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:22.729
That's right.

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:26.149
I'm talking about the country's
very first intelligence agency, the KCIA.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.234
GLOBAL SPY RING EXPOSED

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:31.988
With immense power that
even eclipsed the Constitution,

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:35.450
the KCIA propped up
our dear Mr. President's long reign.

00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:40.914
Just the name of it was enough
to strike fear.

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:42.749
REVOLUTIONARY UNIFICATION
PARTY SPY CASE

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:47.462
So many innocent people were dragged off,
and lost their lives.

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:50.132
Honestly though,

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.677
I never thought I'd be one of them.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.558
This was the age of prohibition,
and my name says it all.

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:02.811
I'm Geumji, as in prohibition. Bae Geumji.

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:08.900
Madam, bar girl, escort, hostess.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:11.319
Call me whatever you want.

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:14.823
What matters is that I was

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.909
damn good at what I did.

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:21.204
But still,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.915
it's not a crime worth dying for, right?

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:28.063
GIMPO AIRPORT, KOREA

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:34.819
Passengers for boarding,
please proceed to Gate Three

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:37.739
of the International Terminal
after completing immigration.

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:45.288
Seriously?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.915
No one's here?

00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:48.750
Wow.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:52.087
This is unbelievable.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.672
Let's go.

00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:02.514
THE AGE OF PROHIBITION

00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:18.905
All right, all right.

00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:06.012
When we get there,
it won't just be Mr. Cheon waiting.

00:06:06.763 --> 00:06:08.348
Bae Geumji will be there too.

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:09.474
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:13.645
They were nice enough
to send her off to the States.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.898
She should've stayed put
and raised her kid quietly.

00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:18.692
What good did she think
would come of this?

00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:32.539
I hear she's a woman with no fear.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.625
Yeah, I'll give her that.

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:37.419
Using her own damn kid like that.

00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:39.587
Do you know, sir?

00:06:40.714 --> 00:06:42.090
Who the father is.

00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:43.675
There are a lot of rumors.

00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:46.845
Hey.

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:48.930
Yes, sir.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.226
Just keep your eyes on the road.

00:06:54.227 --> 00:06:55.812
Unless you've got a death wish.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.818
Have you met Mr. Cheon before?

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:46.404
No, this is my first time in person.

00:07:50.658 --> 00:07:52.577
Born into the elite and

00:07:53.912 --> 00:07:55.789
top of his class at the Military Academy.

00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:59.250
He caught the President's eye
during the revolution,

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:03.338
and now, he throws around
more weight than ever.

00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:09.594
No.

00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:14.140
Cheon Seokjung…

00:08:14.224 --> 00:08:15.975
…Chief of the Presidential
Security Service.

00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:18.978
Top of his class at the Military Academy,
adored by the President.

00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:22.982
The President's power was
practically Cheon Seokjung's to wield,

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:26.945
and the KCIA was his loyal private army.

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:28.988
I mean, look.

00:08:29.072 --> 00:08:30.949
I can't live in hiding forever anyway.

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:33.451
It's not like I'm not a criminal.

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:36.037
I've got to sort things out somehow,

00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:39.999
and raise my boy Seongguk
to not come up short next to anyone.

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:43.336
You really think
his father's going to sit back and watch?

00:08:43.837 --> 00:08:46.005
What kind of father can't stand to see

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:48.007
his own son succeed?

00:08:49.384 --> 00:08:52.095
You know better than anyone
he's not a man to be trifled with.

00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:55.140
And I'm not a woman
to be trifled with either.

00:08:55.723 --> 00:08:56.724
Come on.

00:08:57.225 --> 00:08:59.894
It's not like I'm asking to be his wife.

00:09:02.105 --> 00:09:04.274
Hello, Mr. Cheon.

00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:07.569
How have you been, sir?

00:09:07.652 --> 00:09:09.154
It's been a while, Mr. Hwang.

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:11.781
Why have you been so busy?

00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:14.075
Oh, no. Not at all.

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:19.164
Just give me a call,
and I'll come running anytime, sir.

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.460
Ah… You wear a toupee, huh?

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.766
- Let's take a walk.
- Yes, sir.

00:09:47.984 --> 00:09:51.362
That's when Baek Kitae
saw with his own eyes…

00:09:51.446 --> 00:09:54.949
…what real, living power looked like.

00:09:57.452 --> 00:09:58.995
Ah, I got it.

00:10:02.832 --> 00:10:04.125
And then he decided

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:06.336
to live a life like that man's,

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:09.589
with wealth and power great enough

00:10:10.298 --> 00:10:12.217
to bring the whole world to its knees.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.052
Hello, darling.

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:21.059
I'm going to the restroom.

00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:23.269
Care to join me?

00:10:26.189 --> 00:10:28.358
And that's how we met.

00:10:28.858 --> 00:10:31.903
In the most romantic setting,
as you can see,

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:35.073
in the company of those
government idiots.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.647
There's no need
to worry about wiretaps here, sir.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.107
It's so loud in here.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.068
Loud and perfect
for a secret investigation HQ.

00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:15.071
All right, let's eat.

00:11:15.154 --> 00:11:16.155
Yes, sir.

00:11:21.577 --> 00:11:25.206
Let me say this again, just in case.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.709
No one else can know
about this place but us.

00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:29.544
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

00:11:30.295 --> 00:11:32.171
How's the search for Kang Daeil going?

00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:33.256
Any progress?

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:35.967
Yes,
we're tracing him through his crew.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.760
We should be able to pin him down soon.

00:11:37.844 --> 00:11:39.137
We have to find him.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.513
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:45.393
Apparently, Jo Manjae had his hands
in every racket and made a fortune.

00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:47.020
Smuggling, for starters,

00:11:47.103 --> 00:11:49.814
siphoning US army supplies,
real estate speculation…

00:11:50.398 --> 00:11:52.317
Even the toilet paper
in government offices

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.110
has to pass through his hands.

00:11:54.193 --> 00:11:55.403
He ate all that up by himself?

00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:58.031
Mm-mmm… He couldn't have.

00:11:58.114 --> 00:12:00.908
I mean, look. We can't even
have a meal without sharing.

00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:03.661
You think he can hog the whole thing? How?

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:04.829
He's got backing.

00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:06.998
Mr. Jang.

00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:08.750
You think that's the KCIA, right?

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:12.086
The KCIA doing business with gangsters?
That's nothing new.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.212
I'm not even surprised.

00:12:13.296 --> 00:12:15.673
But why do you think they took Jo Manjae?

00:12:16.257 --> 00:12:18.384
I bet he pulled something shady.

00:12:18.468 --> 00:12:20.261
That must be why they hauled him in.

00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:22.972
They chopped off the tail.
Cut him off like this.

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:24.891
What? You think they killed him?

00:12:24.974 --> 00:12:28.144
Jo Manjae paid up
massive sums to the KCIA.

00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:31.522
And that money went straight
into Director Hwang's safe.

00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:36.194
Some of it probably went
further up the chain too.

00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:39.155
You mean there's someone above Hwang?

00:12:39.864 --> 00:12:42.033
-That's right.
-And who could it be?

00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:44.619
Well, I don't know that yet.

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:46.996
But the election's right
around the corner,

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.623
and plenty of places need funding.

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:52.210
I'm sure they'll restart his operations
by rounding up the rest of his gang.

00:12:52.293 --> 00:12:56.589
To do that, they must've kept
either Jo Manjae or Kang Daeil alive.

00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:58.716
And you think it's Kang Daeil, right?

00:12:59.384 --> 00:13:02.804
We've got a shot
only if Kang Daeil's alive.

00:13:18.945 --> 00:13:21.406
My legs…

00:13:43.594 --> 00:13:45.930
I haven't seen you around before.

00:13:47.056 --> 00:13:48.558
I work under Director Hwang.

00:13:53.896 --> 00:13:55.523
But there's no future

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:57.859
working under Hwang.

00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:01.779
Maybe under Cheon,
that would be different.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.705
If you're interested,

00:14:12.623 --> 00:14:13.791
I can help you.

00:14:15.293 --> 00:14:16.419
What do you mean?

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.214
Let's meet somewhere quiet later.

00:14:20.715 --> 00:14:21.841
Just the two of us.

00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:30.725
- Huh?
- I had him under me for a bit

00:14:30.808 --> 00:14:32.101
in the army.

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:33.186
He's pretty useful.

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:35.897
His eyes are practically dripping
with ambition.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.066
Maybe it's from growing up with nothing.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.736
- But he knows his place.
- I'm getting tipsy. Give me one.

00:14:42.945 --> 00:14:44.447
They make quite the pair.

00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:46.032
Not a bad pick.

00:14:47.116 --> 00:14:48.117
Thank you, sir.

00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:53.331
Geumji. Bae Geumji…

00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:56.459
I can't get a read
on how that woman's going to play this.

00:14:57.793 --> 00:14:58.878
You want me to kill her?

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:04.675
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:06.928
Don't do anything stupid.

00:15:08.804 --> 00:15:10.973
Just have him stick close to her for now.

00:15:11.474 --> 00:15:13.768
Keep an eye on her
so she can't pull anything.

00:15:15.603 --> 00:15:16.604
Yes, sir.

00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:44.382
That woman's got a notebook.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.970
A list of all the men she's slept with.

00:15:49.637 --> 00:15:51.973
Which means the kid's father
has to be in there.

00:15:54.225 --> 00:15:56.560
Now, what's the real issue?
Who the father is?

00:15:57.478 --> 00:15:59.146
That's not the real issue.

00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:03.609
Damn it.

00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:13.786
What matters isn't who the father is.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.538
It's that

00:16:16.163 --> 00:16:19.166
all those men whose names are
in that notebook are losing sleep,

00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:21.377
wondering if the boy is theirs.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.878
That's the real problem.

00:16:22.962 --> 00:16:26.048
Can we trust that information?

00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:27.466
Of course.

00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:30.886
The guy who gave it to me?
His name's in that notebook too.

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:33.806
You'd better keep your head straight.

00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:36.058
She's the kind men fall for
at first sight.

00:16:36.142 --> 00:16:37.852
You don't have to worry about me, sir.

00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:40.062
Ashtray.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.360
Be careful, all right?

00:16:47.028 --> 00:16:50.531
You wouldn't want your name
ending up in that notebook too.

00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:00.750
I swear,

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:04.462
I don't get why everyone's dying
to sink their teeth into me.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.841
Did Director Hwang ask you
to get the notebook?

00:17:10.634 --> 00:17:11.844
What notebook?

00:17:14.638 --> 00:17:16.015
You must be curious,

00:17:16.515 --> 00:17:19.560
being the only one left in the dark.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.438
I'm not interested.

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:24.690
Really?

00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:28.277
Because I could tell you right now

00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:29.904
who the father really is.

00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:39.622
But you're not interested, right?

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:42.416
Are you messing with me?

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.876
Oh, no.

00:17:43.959 --> 00:17:45.628
You thought I was
actually going to tell you?

00:17:48.255 --> 00:17:49.507
You're adorable.

00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:55.388
Anyway, I'm never going back
to the States,

00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:57.181
so tell them to quit dreaming.

00:17:57.264 --> 00:17:58.432
I'm staying right here.

00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:01.268
Maybe even date a handsome guy like you.

00:18:02.812 --> 00:18:04.313
Aren't you sick of men by now?

00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:08.693
Depends on who the man is.

00:18:12.697 --> 00:18:15.324
Since we're here,
why don't we be straight with each other?

00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:20.371
If you don't feel like talking
about dating, we can talk business.

00:18:21.831 --> 00:18:22.832
Business?

00:18:24.834 --> 00:18:26.419
I told you the other day, didn't I?

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:29.130
I could help you.

00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:32.591
Help me with what?
And how exactly?

00:18:37.096 --> 00:18:38.305
Hmm.

00:18:39.682 --> 00:18:41.976
Look who's finally showing some interest.

00:18:50.568 --> 00:18:53.154
Being the President's right-hand man
or whatever…

00:18:53.237 --> 00:18:54.864
Who cares about that crap?

00:18:56.365 --> 00:18:58.451
What matters is

00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:00.202
how you got there.

00:19:02.246 --> 00:19:03.247
You know well

00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:06.584
how Hwang managed to get as far as he did,

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:08.002
don't you?

00:19:10.755 --> 00:19:15.634
Now, just think how much more
Cheon must've passed up above him.

00:19:16.469 --> 00:19:18.220
An endless stream of cash.

00:19:18.304 --> 00:19:21.265
That's the real source of their power.

00:19:27.396 --> 00:19:28.397
So…

00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:31.525
If you had your hands on that stream,

00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:33.819
who's to say

00:19:34.487 --> 00:19:37.239
you couldn't get to Cheon's level,
not just Hwang's?

00:19:38.032 --> 00:19:39.033
Am I right?

00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:40.826
Mr. Baek.

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:43.287
Tell me what you want.

00:19:44.747 --> 00:19:45.915
I'll help you.

00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.544
I heard you've got ties
to the Japanese yakuza.

00:19:51.879 --> 00:19:53.088
Chairman Ikeda.

00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:56.008
Have you ever met him?

00:19:56.634 --> 00:19:58.010
Boss!

00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:04.642
No.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:08.479
But I did catch a glimpse
of his daughter once.

00:20:09.021 --> 00:20:10.105
Ikeda Yuji.

00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:13.234
Real name, Choi Yuji.

00:20:13.317 --> 00:20:14.693
Yes, Choi Yuji.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:17.947
How did you know she's Korean?

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.782
I've met her myself once.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:24.537
If only she weren't of Korean descent,

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.997
she might have even had a shot
at being his successor.

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:30.793
She's a Zainichi, but he still
took her in as his foster daughter.

00:20:32.169 --> 00:20:34.255
I don't know how she won his favor,

00:20:34.797 --> 00:20:36.298
but he clearly treasures her.

00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:45.808
Anyway, I'm certain she's one
of the real powers in the Ikeda clan.

00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:49.103
How on earth do you know all this?

00:20:50.354 --> 00:20:53.983
So, what about Choi Yuji?

00:20:55.442 --> 00:20:58.571
I think… …I need to see her again.

00:20:59.697 --> 00:21:00.739
Hmm…

00:21:00.823 --> 00:21:01.824
Okay.

00:21:06.245 --> 00:21:07.705
Call me, Mr. Baek.

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:26.682
Guys, this is Lee Sunyeong.

00:21:26.765 --> 00:21:28.726
She's a new member of Rose Club.

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:29.894
Say hello.

00:21:29.977 --> 00:21:32.146
Hi, nice to meet you all.

00:21:32.229 --> 00:21:35.524
I'm Lee Sunyeong.

00:21:35.608 --> 00:21:38.694
I'm not very good with my hands though.

00:21:40.195 --> 00:21:42.156
Anyway, I'm excited to be here.

00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:45.117
Come on,
no one's good from the start.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.619
- Welcome to the club.
- Thanks.

00:21:46.702 --> 00:21:48.203
Here, try knitting this first.

00:21:49.747 --> 00:21:51.040
Hi, Soyeong.

00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:52.666
You got off work a bit late today.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.834
Yeah.

00:21:53.918 --> 00:21:56.378
Oh, I see you guys have already started.

00:21:56.462 --> 00:21:58.839
Soyeong, did you get
what I asked for last time?

00:21:58.923 --> 00:22:00.841
Yeah,
I brought the information sheet.

00:22:02.301 --> 00:22:06.472
It's a three-year term
with an annual interest rate of 17.4%…

00:22:06.555 --> 00:22:09.099
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much, Soyeong.

00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:14.229
Are you from Seoul?

00:22:15.564 --> 00:22:17.024
Sorry?

00:22:17.107 --> 00:22:20.444
You don't seem to have a Busan accent.

00:22:20.527 --> 00:22:25.199
That's because
Soyeong grew up in Japan.

00:22:25.741 --> 00:22:27.451
Soyeong, say hello.

00:22:27.534 --> 00:22:31.163
This is Lee Sunyeong.
She's a new member of the club.

00:22:31.246 --> 00:22:32.831
Of course.

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:36.293
No wonder you've got
such great skin.

00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:39.380
My goodness. How's your skin so smooth?

00:22:39.463 --> 00:22:42.633
Oh, you're too kind.

00:22:42.716 --> 00:22:45.594
Well, I was just born with it.

00:22:45.678 --> 00:22:47.554
You're so lucky.

00:22:48.514 --> 00:22:51.850
My uncle lives in Japan too. In Osaka.

00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:54.228
No way! I lived in Osaka too!

00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:55.938
Oh, my goodness.

00:22:56.438 --> 00:22:59.066
What are the chances?

00:23:00.776 --> 00:23:03.779
-Wow, you work at a bank?
-Oh, yeah.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.157
What do you do
for a living, Sunyeong?

00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:08.742
Well…

00:23:09.243 --> 00:23:11.537
My parents run…
What do you call that again?

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.955
They run a metal shop…

00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:15.874
…so I help out with my older brothers.

00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:17.835
What about you, Soyeong?

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:19.211
Do you have an older brother?

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.921
Yeah.

00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:24.550
Well, I've never told you guys,

00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:27.594
but my brother could give Shin Seongil
a run for his money.

00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:29.179
My brother looks like Alain Delon!

00:23:29.263 --> 00:23:31.432
Really? We have so much in common!

00:23:31.515 --> 00:23:33.517
Wow,
are they really that handsome?

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.645
-You should bring him here sometime.
-Oh, I can't do that. He's busy.

00:23:36.729 --> 00:23:38.814
- Bring him.
- I've got to see with my own eyes.

00:23:38.897 --> 00:23:41.191
- He must be really handsome.
- You bet.

00:23:43.152 --> 00:23:44.445
The Vietnam War, huh?

00:23:44.528 --> 00:23:45.738
PERSONAL RECORD
NAME: BAEK KITAE

00:23:45.821 --> 00:23:46.947
Yes.

00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:50.492
He was in the Special Warfare Command
but got dishonorably discharged there.

00:23:50.576 --> 00:23:53.037
It seems like there was
some kind of incident.

00:23:54.163 --> 00:23:57.666
Sir, I heard rumors
you got the Order of Military Merit,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.126
but that's not true, right?

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.551
Well…

00:24:11.847 --> 00:24:14.600
I mean, it was from the government,

00:24:15.684 --> 00:24:17.186
so I couldn't exactly refuse.

00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:19.229
Seriously?

00:24:19.313 --> 00:24:22.274
There were three armed guerrillas.

00:24:22.357 --> 00:24:25.194
Armed guerrillas?

00:24:25.277 --> 00:24:27.112
You going to tell me you've been shot too?

00:24:27.196 --> 00:24:28.197
-Here.
-Huh?

00:24:28.947 --> 00:24:30.199
- Here.
- Wait.

00:24:30.282 --> 00:24:32.868
Are you actually telling me
this is from a gunshot?

00:24:32.951 --> 00:24:34.745
- It went in here and…
- Yeah?

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.831
- I'm not sure if you can see it. Here.
- Whoa, what?

00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:38.999
Wait a second.

00:24:39.083 --> 00:24:41.460
So it went in here and came out here?

00:24:41.543 --> 00:24:44.421
Wow, so it's true!

00:24:44.505 --> 00:24:46.173
You're incredible, Mr. Jang.

00:24:46.256 --> 00:24:49.301
Well, they wouldn't have
given me the medal if I weren't.

00:24:52.262 --> 00:24:54.389
Oh, my.

00:24:55.724 --> 00:24:56.725
My goodness.

00:24:57.392 --> 00:24:58.393
Oh, my…

00:24:59.186 --> 00:25:02.356
Mr. Jang, you must work out all the time.

00:25:02.439 --> 00:25:04.900
Yeah, well, I just do some push-ups.

00:25:04.983 --> 00:25:06.318
Of course.

00:25:06.401 --> 00:25:08.362
No wonder you look so good in your suits.

00:25:09.113 --> 00:25:10.322
How many do you do?

00:25:10.405 --> 00:25:12.866
A hundred? Yeah, about a hundred.

00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:15.202
So, how did it go?

00:25:15.285 --> 00:25:16.745
Did you meet her?

00:25:19.998 --> 00:25:22.126
I'm so tired.

00:25:22.209 --> 00:25:25.212
It's true they grew up in Osaka, Japan.

00:25:25.295 --> 00:25:26.964
- They're Zainichi?
- Yes.

00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:29.383
They came back to Korea
after their parents passed.

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:31.844
Apparently, they had a tough time
settling down here.

00:25:31.927 --> 00:25:34.429
Then Baek Kitae must've had
to play the parent.

00:25:34.513 --> 00:25:36.140
He did
every kind of job imaginable

00:25:36.223 --> 00:25:37.933
to support his younger siblings.

00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:40.644
And being Zainichi,
he went through a lot of discrimination.

00:25:40.727 --> 00:25:42.354
So he became a career soldier?

00:25:42.437 --> 00:25:44.815
There's actually another soldier
in the family.

00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:47.484
Their younger brother, Baek Kihyun.

00:25:47.568 --> 00:25:50.904
He graduated top of his class
from the Military Academy.

00:25:50.988 --> 00:25:53.407
Now, he's serving up front
as a second lieutenant.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.119
The older brother's in the KCIA,
and the younger one's from the Academy?

00:25:57.661 --> 00:25:59.663
Well, talk about rising from nothing.

00:25:59.746 --> 00:26:04.126
But it sounded like something happened
to the younger brother when he was a kid.

00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:05.627
What happened?

00:26:05.711 --> 00:26:09.965
Well, Baek Soyeong didn't go into detail,
but she seemed really worried about him.

00:26:11.383 --> 00:26:12.384
Okay.

00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:15.012
So, are you meeting her again?

00:26:15.095 --> 00:26:17.973
Yes, we hit it off and decided
to grab a meal together sometime.

00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:20.976
Also, Kang Daeil?

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.895
He's alive.

00:26:25.147 --> 00:26:27.482
You've tracked him down?

00:26:27.566 --> 00:26:31.361
Not exactly. But word is,
he's putting the gang back together.

00:26:31.445 --> 00:26:32.696
He's even looking for a chemist.

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:35.699
See? I told you,
Kang Daeil, that bastard, is alive.

00:26:35.782 --> 00:26:38.285
Your instincts are spot-on, sir.

00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:39.870
I'm telling you,

00:26:40.662 --> 00:26:42.998
Kang Daeil is tied up with the KCIA.

00:26:46.752 --> 00:26:49.296
The KCIA can take down
anyone in their sights.

00:26:50.047 --> 00:26:52.466
Mr. Jang, if you push too far
and things go sideways--

00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:54.259
I'll take the fall.

00:26:54.343 --> 00:26:56.303
If anyone loses their job,
it's going to be me.

00:27:05.812 --> 00:27:12.194
OSAKA, JAPAN

00:27:12.903 --> 00:27:15.322
You have guests from Korea.

00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:52.985
Long time no see, Ms. Bae.

00:27:53.485 --> 00:27:55.487
It's good to see you, Ms. Ikeda.

00:27:56.154 --> 00:27:58.615
It's been a while, Mr. Matsuda.

00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:02.661
Or should I call you
Mr. Baek Kitae now?

00:28:03.245 --> 00:28:04.830
I'm Baek Kitae.

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.040
It's good to see you.

00:28:13.797 --> 00:28:17.926
You've got
a lovely little place here.

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:22.806
How's the chairman doing?

00:28:23.682 --> 00:28:25.600
I heard he hasn't been well.

00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:28.562
Is your son doing well?

00:28:31.606 --> 00:28:34.818
He's… just like his father.

00:28:36.695 --> 00:28:37.738
That's good.

00:28:38.572 --> 00:28:40.198
When are you going back to America?

00:28:40.282 --> 00:28:41.908
I'm not going back.

00:28:41.992 --> 00:28:43.744
I've got some things to do in Korea.

00:28:46.371 --> 00:28:48.206
And I've met someone I like.

00:28:49.833 --> 00:28:51.209
You haven't eaten, right?

00:28:51.293 --> 00:28:52.377
Gosh, I'm starving.

00:28:52.461 --> 00:28:55.005
I heard there's
a famous sushi place nearby.

00:28:55.088 --> 00:28:57.883
I actually made a reservation there
when I heard you were coming.

00:28:59.885 --> 00:29:02.512
Darling, you like sushi, right?
This is great.

00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:04.765
Mr. Baek, you should have
a drink with me instead.

00:29:04.848 --> 00:29:06.641
I have something to discuss in private.

00:29:07.434 --> 00:29:09.394
My staff will escort you, Ms. Bae.

00:29:09.895 --> 00:29:12.189
You've done your part.

00:29:12.272 --> 00:29:14.649
Now, it's Mr. Baek's turn
to finish things.

00:29:15.233 --> 00:29:19.362
I'm sure he didn't come all this way
just to have some sushi with me.

00:29:20.072 --> 00:29:21.740
Am I right, Mr. Baek?

00:29:25.077 --> 00:29:27.537
Does Ms. Bae know why we're meeting?

00:29:29.331 --> 00:29:30.332
No.

00:29:31.208 --> 00:29:33.001
She wouldn't have the faintest idea.

00:29:33.085 --> 00:29:35.629
So you want to do business with me
in Jo Manjae's place?

00:29:35.712 --> 00:29:37.756
A senior KCIA agent himself?

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.758
Is that a problem?

00:29:39.841 --> 00:29:41.093
Does Director Hwang know?

00:29:41.635 --> 00:29:42.928
Does he need to?

00:29:44.096 --> 00:29:46.765
By the way… …how do you know him?

00:29:46.848 --> 00:29:48.517
I used to work with him.

00:29:49.184 --> 00:29:50.185
On what?

00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:51.937
Just some business.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.694
"Chairman of the Korea-Japan
Cultural Exchange Foundation."

00:29:59.778 --> 00:30:03.198
"Director of the Korea-Japan
Development Council."

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.077
Since when do yakuza
do this kind of thing?

00:30:14.292 --> 00:30:16.545
We do anything that makes money,

00:30:16.628 --> 00:30:17.879
just like you.

00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:23.260
Are you serious about doing this right?

00:30:24.427 --> 00:30:25.762
If we're not doing it right,

00:30:26.763 --> 00:30:28.265
then I'm not doing it at all.

00:30:43.655 --> 00:30:45.866
If you don't hold up your end again,

00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:49.995
I'll make sure you pay for it,
even for wasting my time.

00:30:51.621 --> 00:30:53.623
That sounds like a threat.

00:30:55.917 --> 00:30:56.918
It is a threat.

00:30:57.919 --> 00:30:59.462
If you can't handle it, walk away.

00:31:10.932 --> 00:31:13.226
Let me ask you one thing.

00:31:17.189 --> 00:31:18.732
Did you want to see me?

00:31:20.233 --> 00:31:22.861
I wanted to see you.

00:31:29.284 --> 00:31:30.952
Mr. Baek!

00:31:34.581 --> 00:31:37.417
Darling,
were you okay without me?

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.961
Did you enjoy shopping, Ms. Bae?

00:31:40.045 --> 00:31:43.757
Yeah, I picked up a few briefs
for my dear Mr. Baek.

00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:05.654
HAPPY BUSAN CITIZENS' DAY

00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:10.784
Hello, Director Hwang.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.079
Jang Geonyoung,
Special Investigations, Busan Office.

00:32:15.413 --> 00:32:16.915
Oh, right.

00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:22.420
I heard you've been working hard
chasing after those junkies.

00:32:22.504 --> 00:32:23.838
Me? Not at all.

00:32:24.339 --> 00:32:26.383
You're the one
who must have it rough, sir.

00:32:26.883 --> 00:32:29.344
With all the big names in Busan
in the palm of your hand,

00:32:29.427 --> 00:32:32.681
I can only imagine
how much work that takes.

00:32:34.975 --> 00:32:37.852
I don't know what you've heard exactly.

00:32:39.145 --> 00:32:40.355
But narcotics cases?

00:32:40.855 --> 00:32:42.857
You just end up
chasing the tail all night.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.319
-You've got your share of headaches.
-That's why

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.947
I was hoping to ask you for some intel.

00:32:49.614 --> 00:32:50.740
What kind of intel?

00:32:50.824 --> 00:32:52.867
You know Jo Manjae well, right?

00:32:53.868 --> 00:32:54.995
The Manjae Gang boss.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.831
Well, I guess
I know about as much as you do.

00:32:58.999 --> 00:33:00.000
But I was told

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.378
he disappeared. Isn't that right?

00:33:03.461 --> 00:33:04.713
Yes, that's right.

00:33:04.796 --> 00:33:07.090
He did disappear, without a trace.

00:33:07.757 --> 00:33:10.135
But just when I started
investigating again,

00:33:11.052 --> 00:33:14.306
a witness pops up saying they'd seen him
in the Philippines.

00:33:14.848 --> 00:33:18.393
And the next thing I know,
the higher-ups shut it all down.

00:33:19.728 --> 00:33:21.646
So what exactly is it

00:33:23.231 --> 00:33:24.607
that you want to know?

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.320
Whether he's alive in the Philippines

00:33:28.403 --> 00:33:30.530
or rotting somewhere, that can wait.

00:33:30.613 --> 00:33:34.326
But who has taken over his operation

00:33:34.409 --> 00:33:37.787
and is running
the drug trade here in Busan?

00:33:39.622 --> 00:33:41.333
That's what I want to know.

00:33:48.506 --> 00:33:49.883
That's news to me.

00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:52.177
Someone's definitely taken it over.

00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:53.678
I'm sure of it.

00:33:56.765 --> 00:33:58.683
Rounding up the leftover goons,

00:33:59.434 --> 00:34:01.394
and trying to bring in a new cook.

00:34:04.189 --> 00:34:05.190
Ah…

00:34:06.024 --> 00:34:07.025
By the way,

00:34:07.108 --> 00:34:09.694
I don't see your guy here. Baek Kitae?

00:34:09.778 --> 00:34:11.029
He's usually with you.

00:34:11.529 --> 00:34:14.074
I guess the KCIA
must be swamped these days.

00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:20.455
You're good at peeling these.

00:34:20.538 --> 00:34:21.956
I can never get it right.

00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:23.792
Is that so?

00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:26.920
-Want me to peel one for you?
-Would you?

00:34:27.003 --> 00:34:28.004
Sure.

00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:31.966
Here.

00:34:32.634 --> 00:34:33.802
You grab the legs

00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:37.013
and peel it off like this.

00:34:37.097 --> 00:34:38.098
There.

00:34:38.598 --> 00:34:40.141
-For you, sir.
-Thanks.

00:34:45.897 --> 00:34:47.190
-Go ahead.
-All right.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.531
Mr. Jang!

00:34:57.617 --> 00:34:58.827
How did it go?

00:35:00.328 --> 00:35:02.455
Seeing how he played dumb,

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:04.499
it's clear the KCIA
took care of Jo Manjae.

00:35:04.582 --> 00:35:07.919
So, does that mean
Director Hwang killed him off

00:35:08.002 --> 00:35:10.088
and is pushing meth himself?

00:35:11.881 --> 00:35:15.009
I don't think Director Hwang
knows much about the drugs.

00:35:18.304 --> 00:35:19.931
Then who the hell is it?

00:35:20.014 --> 00:35:21.933
When are you meeting Baek Soyeong?

00:35:26.563 --> 00:35:27.897
Do you think…

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.318
Baek Kitae is trying to push meth
behind Hwang's back?

00:35:32.402 --> 00:35:34.112
I threw it out there,

00:35:35.238 --> 00:35:36.406
so let's wait and see

00:35:37.323 --> 00:35:40.160
if Baek Kitae is really running drugs.

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:44.748
Have you lost your mind?

00:35:45.749 --> 00:35:47.333
A KCIA agent dealing meth?

00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:49.461
What are you thinking? Huh?

00:35:49.544 --> 00:35:51.421
Are you trying to get us all killed?

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.051
I'm doing this so we can all survive.

00:36:00.513 --> 00:36:01.848
After Mom died,

00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:05.226
how did the three of us make it to Busan?

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.103
And what's our life been like?

00:36:07.187 --> 00:36:10.607
If we keep living like this,
nothing will be different in 10, 20 years.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.817
We'll never get out
of this damn hillside slum.

00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:15.737
Soyeong.

00:36:16.613 --> 00:36:17.697
Don't you trust me?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.910
Say I bring in just one kilo.
That costs 200,000 won.

00:36:21.993 --> 00:36:25.663
Cook it and sell it, that's 5 million.
Ship it to Japan, 15 million.

00:36:27.373 --> 00:36:28.374
Fif…

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:32.212
Fifteen million won?

00:36:33.963 --> 00:36:35.799
Plus, I'm not doing this alone.

00:36:35.882 --> 00:36:37.342
People above me…

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:41.763
We're all in on it.

00:36:41.846 --> 00:36:43.890
Above you? The KCIA?

00:36:44.641 --> 00:36:45.683
How high up?

00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:47.143
Way up.

00:36:48.895 --> 00:36:51.022
Which means
there's no risk of getting caught.

00:36:51.523 --> 00:36:53.233
No.

00:36:53.817 --> 00:36:56.110
There will be addicts.

00:36:56.611 --> 00:37:00.406
It'll wreck the country, right when
they're trying to build a new era.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.160
Kitae, no, I'd feel too guilty.

00:37:04.661 --> 00:37:06.663
You don't have to worry about that.

00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:08.790
We'll make it here,

00:37:08.873 --> 00:37:10.542
but we'll ship it all out to Japan.

00:37:11.292 --> 00:37:12.460
Japan?

00:37:12.544 --> 00:37:14.420
Yeah. We'll be
bringing in foreign currency,

00:37:14.504 --> 00:37:16.548
and we'll be the ones driving exports.

00:37:17.298 --> 00:37:18.550
If the business goes well,

00:37:19.259 --> 00:37:21.135
we'll be doing our part
in building the new era.

00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:22.887
Our family won't be left behind.

00:37:22.971 --> 00:37:25.223
We'll be at the forefront
if we get with the times.

00:37:25.306 --> 00:37:27.308
That means we're serving the country.

00:37:27.392 --> 00:37:28.434
It's patriotic work.

00:37:29.185 --> 00:37:30.186
Patriotic?

00:37:31.271 --> 00:37:32.272
Yes.

00:37:34.732 --> 00:37:37.068
Don't tell Kihyun.
He doesn't need to know.

00:37:38.403 --> 00:37:39.404
Okay.

00:37:40.947 --> 00:37:43.533
You just need to take care of the money

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:46.786
and keep an eye on Kang Daeil, all right?

00:37:48.788 --> 00:37:49.789
Mmm.

00:38:36.544 --> 00:38:37.879
Yeah. Thank you, sir.

00:38:47.847 --> 00:38:49.182
Our goal…

00:38:51.809 --> 00:38:53.394
is to make the best product

00:38:53.478 --> 00:38:55.104
and take over the Japanese market.

00:38:57.357 --> 00:38:58.566
What about Korea?

00:38:59.484 --> 00:39:01.277
Focus on Japan for now.

00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:03.404
Don't put anything out in Korea
without my approval.

00:39:03.905 --> 00:39:04.906
Understood.

00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:10.119
What about the chemist?

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.457
We've got someone
with sharp eyes and skilled hands.

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.085
He's made quite a name
for himself in this business.

00:39:17.168 --> 00:39:19.420
It wasn't easy,
but I managed to bring him in.

00:39:19.504 --> 00:39:24.092
The best of the best, as pure as possible.

00:39:26.511 --> 00:39:28.972
That's how we win the Japanese over.

00:39:29.055 --> 00:39:30.139
You know that, right?

00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:31.766
Understood, sir.

00:39:34.978 --> 00:39:37.814
And I'm bringing one more person on board.

00:39:39.691 --> 00:39:40.942
Who is it?

00:39:42.318 --> 00:39:43.611
The place has a nice view.

00:39:44.821 --> 00:39:46.906
Right. Yeah, very nice.

00:39:54.288 --> 00:39:55.498
Let's do this!

00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:59.210
Yeah, let's do this!

00:40:19.147 --> 00:40:21.441
All right, the pigs are here.

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:34.954
Okay, let's go.

00:40:38.791 --> 00:40:40.209
Come on, let's go.

00:40:43.004 --> 00:40:44.088
Go on, get in there.

00:40:51.721 --> 00:40:53.056
They stink bad, huh?

00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:54.140
It's fine.

00:41:00.897 --> 00:41:02.523
Here, this will help.

00:41:12.366 --> 00:41:13.493
I'm Kang Daeil.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.661
I've heard a lot about you.

00:41:15.745 --> 00:41:17.705
If it ever gets tough, just let me know.

00:41:17.789 --> 00:41:18.790
Tough? No way.

00:41:18.873 --> 00:41:20.333
This is patriotic work after all.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.461
Patriotic?

00:41:24.462 --> 00:41:26.130
That's nice.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.592
Man, smells real sweet.

00:41:30.093 --> 00:41:31.594
Make sure they have plenty to eat!

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.851
We've got the pigs here.

00:41:38.935 --> 00:41:40.103
You want to get started?

00:41:49.028 --> 00:41:50.029
Mr. Kang.

00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:52.115
I have a question.

00:41:52.198 --> 00:41:53.658
Why did you bring pigs here?

00:41:53.741 --> 00:41:55.451
They cost money, don't they?

00:41:56.285 --> 00:41:58.955
It stinks when you cook meth, you know.

00:41:59.038 --> 00:42:00.039
And?

00:42:00.623 --> 00:42:02.375
You cover it with the smell of pig crap.

00:42:02.959 --> 00:42:04.335
Ah…

00:42:04.418 --> 00:42:05.419
Hey.

00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:12.802
Hey.

00:42:14.137 --> 00:42:15.138
What?

00:42:34.365 --> 00:42:37.368
DIRECTOR GENERAL HWANG GUKPYEONG

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.581
This month's take looks a little light.

00:42:43.749 --> 00:42:47.670
Kang Daeil's still trying
to pull the gang back together, so…

00:42:50.631 --> 00:42:52.675
Fine. More importantly,

00:42:54.468 --> 00:42:55.887
who did she meet in Osaka?

00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:00.057
Bae Geumji.

00:43:01.475 --> 00:43:03.144
No one in particular.

00:43:04.103 --> 00:43:05.813
She just went shopping and sightseeing.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.732
Shopping, huh?

00:43:08.232 --> 00:43:10.234
And I'm losing my mind over here.

00:43:11.777 --> 00:43:13.112
Where's that tramp now?

00:43:13.779 --> 00:43:16.157
She's staying with her family
to take care of her kid.

00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:18.409
Lee's keeping an eye on her now.

00:43:18.492 --> 00:43:20.203
I'll be taking over again tomorrow.

00:43:21.412 --> 00:43:22.538
Right, I appreciate it.

00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:26.250
Phone in every two hours.

00:43:27.001 --> 00:43:28.002
Yes, sir.

00:43:30.379 --> 00:43:31.380
You can go.

00:43:50.983 --> 00:43:52.068
Yes, sir.

00:43:52.652 --> 00:43:53.861
Send Pyo in.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.197
Yes, sir. I will.

00:43:56.948 --> 00:43:58.324
Mr. Pyo, he'll see you now.

00:44:11.545 --> 00:44:13.422
- Did you find out?
- Yes, sir.

00:44:13.506 --> 00:44:16.676
Baek Kitae met with Ikeda Yuji in Osaka.

00:44:17.593 --> 00:44:18.636
Choi Yuji?

00:44:18.719 --> 00:44:19.720
Yes, sir.

00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:23.557
Baek Kitae…

00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:26.143
met with Choi Yuji?

00:44:27.436 --> 00:44:28.521
That little bastard.

00:44:29.313 --> 00:44:31.607
I told him to shut down the meth business…

00:44:31.691 --> 00:44:34.443
…and now he's going all in on it?

00:44:34.527 --> 00:44:38.406
It looks like he and Kang Daeil
have taken over the whole Manjae Gang.

00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:44.787
I guess I've been raising
a tiger all along, huh?

00:44:46.539 --> 00:44:50.960
If word gets out the KCIA's pushing meth,
it'll be a hell of a show, won't it?

00:44:55.506 --> 00:44:56.507
Sir.

00:44:58.509 --> 00:44:59.510
But the thing is,

00:45:00.553 --> 00:45:03.723
I hear the profits are massive.

00:45:04.765 --> 00:45:06.183
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

00:45:15.985 --> 00:45:17.445
How much are we talking?

00:45:18.738 --> 00:45:21.282
I'll get back to you with exact numbers.

00:45:38.924 --> 00:45:41.052
What did you pray for?

00:45:42.053 --> 00:45:44.013
The country's well-being
and world peace.

00:45:47.391 --> 00:45:48.392
I'm serious.

00:45:50.895 --> 00:45:52.021
Don't you ever pray?

00:45:55.024 --> 00:45:56.817
Does He ever answer your prayers?

00:45:58.194 --> 00:45:59.195
Of course.

00:45:59.945 --> 00:46:03.032
If you really want it
with all your heart, He does.

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:08.829
Ms. Bae,
what is it that you really want?

00:46:15.378 --> 00:46:18.047
Does the notebook even exist?

00:46:25.012 --> 00:46:27.056
What about you? What do you really want?

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.601
Money?

00:46:31.519 --> 00:46:32.520
Power?

00:46:33.813 --> 00:46:34.814
Love?

00:46:41.404 --> 00:46:42.655
You want it all, don't you?

00:46:44.156 --> 00:46:45.950
So no one can ever look down on you.

00:46:51.789 --> 00:46:52.790
So do I.

00:46:55.084 --> 00:46:56.085
Same as you.

00:47:03.134 --> 00:47:04.677
Fucking hell.

00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:08.556
Bow properly, damn it!

00:47:16.897 --> 00:47:17.898
Hello?

00:47:18.399 --> 00:47:19.650
Hey, where the hell are you?

00:47:19.733 --> 00:47:20.985
Where's Bae Geumji?

00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:23.362
She's attending church service.

00:47:23.446 --> 00:47:26.073
That bitch wants
to see the President today!

00:47:27.992 --> 00:47:30.453
He'll be inspecting
Seoul National University in a bit,

00:47:30.536 --> 00:47:33.122
and that crazy bitch is planning
to show up there!

00:47:34.457 --> 00:47:35.458
Hey!

00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:38.502
If you lose her, you and I are finished.
You get that, right?

00:47:38.586 --> 00:47:40.963
You get that or not, you little shit?

00:47:55.769 --> 00:47:57.062
Bae Geumji!

00:48:06.447 --> 00:48:09.408
Na Yongcheol,
Chief of Staff to the President.

00:48:10.576 --> 00:48:13.954
Cheon Seokjung's sole rival
and his closest enemy.

00:48:14.538 --> 00:48:18.292
You think you can just pop out a kid
and turn your life around?

00:48:20.794 --> 00:48:22.880
Well,
I figured I'd give it a try.

00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:25.716
See if it works.

00:48:27.635 --> 00:48:29.011
There's only one kid.

00:48:29.887 --> 00:48:31.347
How many fathers does he have?

00:48:32.223 --> 00:48:34.266
You looking to milk everyone dry?

00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:38.270
Hmm…

00:48:38.354 --> 00:48:39.980
You and I

00:48:41.023 --> 00:48:42.024
both know

00:48:42.733 --> 00:48:44.068
who the father is.

00:48:44.151 --> 00:48:45.945
What matters isn't the truth.

00:48:46.028 --> 00:48:48.531
What matters is

00:48:49.198 --> 00:48:51.825
what people believe, Mr. Na.

00:48:51.909 --> 00:48:55.454
Either way, they all believe
what they want to believe.

00:48:56.121 --> 00:48:57.122
And?

00:48:58.707 --> 00:49:00.876
You're just going to let them believe it?

00:49:03.087 --> 00:49:04.672
Why not? It doesn't hurt me.

00:49:04.755 --> 00:49:08.467
There's no reason for me to run around
telling people the whole story, is there?

00:49:08.551 --> 00:49:11.262
Well,
if it bothers you that much,

00:49:12.638 --> 00:49:14.848
why don't you go ahead
and tell them yourself?

00:49:14.932 --> 00:49:17.977
So the country can go to hell,
as long as you save your own skin?

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.812
All those men you're stirring up

00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:22.940
are those working hard
to keep this country going.

00:49:23.023 --> 00:49:24.024
Exactly.

00:49:24.775 --> 00:49:26.860
Which is why I'm asking for your help.

00:49:28.195 --> 00:49:30.739
I want to be able
to care about the country too.

00:49:30.823 --> 00:49:31.824
You know,

00:49:32.491 --> 00:49:34.868
you could really end up dead
if you keep this up.

00:49:34.952 --> 00:49:37.955
Don't you know any of them could easily
get rid of someone like you?

00:49:42.918 --> 00:49:43.919
Doesn't matter.

00:49:44.962 --> 00:49:47.131
No matter what anyone says,
I'm not leaving.

00:49:50.009 --> 00:49:51.010
So help me.

00:49:57.182 --> 00:49:59.810
Come on. After everything…

00:50:02.438 --> 00:50:05.190
I can ask you that much, can't I?

00:50:06.442 --> 00:50:07.610
Hmm?

00:50:07.693 --> 00:50:08.694
Truth is,

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:11.655
I've been thinking
of starting my own business.

00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:14.241
I've always wanted to.

00:50:15.034 --> 00:50:18.037
A courtesan house, bigger than Cheonungak.

00:50:18.787 --> 00:50:19.997
How does that sound?

00:50:20.497 --> 00:50:22.958
I've already got my eye
on the building and the land.

00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:24.752
Hmm…

00:50:24.835 --> 00:50:28.505
And I think I'd like a villa too.
Everyone else has one.

00:50:30.215 --> 00:50:31.216
What do you think?

00:50:38.098 --> 00:50:39.099
Mr. Na.

00:50:42.019 --> 00:50:43.187
Don't take this lightly.

00:50:45.356 --> 00:50:46.857
Because everything I said today?

00:50:49.693 --> 00:50:51.362
I meant every word.

00:50:55.282 --> 00:50:56.742
You crazy bitch.

00:50:56.825 --> 00:50:58.452
Are you threatening me right now?

00:51:12.341 --> 00:51:13.467
So, you're saying…

00:51:15.636 --> 00:51:16.845
She went to see

00:51:17.596 --> 00:51:19.598
Chief Na, not the President?

00:51:19.682 --> 00:51:20.933
Yes, sir.

00:51:21.016 --> 00:51:22.643
That crazy bitch.

00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:27.314
She's digging her own grave, isn't she?

00:51:30.484 --> 00:51:31.485
What about Baek?

00:51:32.528 --> 00:51:34.071
He's standing by in Seoul.

00:51:34.947 --> 00:51:38.367
Goddamn idiot,
falling for some tramp like that.

00:51:42.955 --> 00:51:44.873
Still, the woman's a real piece of work.

00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:47.918
She just had to stir up the hornet's nest

00:51:49.253 --> 00:51:51.588
and throw all the men upstairs into chaos.

00:51:52.715 --> 00:51:55.467
I can't tell if she's naïve
or just plain stupid.

00:51:59.304 --> 00:52:00.806
-Hey.
-Yes, sir?

00:52:01.557 --> 00:52:02.891
Have you ever been in love?

00:52:05.394 --> 00:52:06.979
I'm not so sure.

00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:15.446
She's pulling all this shit
just because she wants to be loved.

00:52:25.622 --> 00:52:27.040
Fucking bitch.

00:52:28.459 --> 00:52:30.544
That's right.

00:52:31.378 --> 00:52:34.089
This was the night I last saw him.

00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:38.719
It was the first time
he'd ever asked to meet,

00:52:39.762 --> 00:52:41.805
so I wondered what it was about.

00:52:48.937 --> 00:52:49.938
Darling.

00:52:51.482 --> 00:52:53.275
Are you mad at me?

00:52:59.072 --> 00:53:00.282
Go back.

00:53:01.408 --> 00:53:02.910
Are you really going to do this?

00:53:03.994 --> 00:53:05.162
You're ruining the mood.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.548
Those guys can't do anything to me.

00:53:18.217 --> 00:53:19.676
I've got my notebook.

00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:22.930
Hand that over and get out of the country

00:53:23.597 --> 00:53:24.932
if you want to stay alive.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.768
If I hand that over…

00:53:30.062 --> 00:53:31.230
they'll kill me.

00:53:31.313 --> 00:53:33.357
And they'll kill you if you don't.

00:53:37.903 --> 00:53:40.989
Why are you trying to scare me like this?

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.668
Enough games.

00:53:53.627 --> 00:53:55.170
Hand over the notebook, now.

00:53:56.213 --> 00:53:57.548
And if I don't?

00:53:59.216 --> 00:54:00.968
You might not make it through the night.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.931
My God.

00:54:06.932 --> 00:54:08.976
How do you even make threats look so cool?

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.354
Do you practice in front of a mirror
or something?

00:54:15.566 --> 00:54:16.692
Gosh, that hurt.

00:54:23.991 --> 00:54:25.617
It never existed.

00:54:29.746 --> 00:54:30.873
The notebook.

00:54:31.498 --> 00:54:32.749
It never existed.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.626
I'm telling you the truth

00:54:35.335 --> 00:54:37.629
because I think you figured that out
a long time ago.

00:54:47.264 --> 00:54:49.224
Stay with me tonight.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.353
I don't want to be alone.

00:54:54.104 --> 00:54:56.189
You said I might not make it
through the night.

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:58.775
If something happens to me,

00:55:00.235 --> 00:55:01.778
you'll have to save me.

00:55:07.284 --> 00:55:08.910
Why should I do that?

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:15.167
You think I don't know?

00:55:19.171 --> 00:55:21.798
About whatever deal
you've got going with Choi Yuji.

00:55:23.258 --> 00:55:25.010
Did you think I wouldn't figure it out?

00:55:30.891 --> 00:55:33.810
You can't do this to me.

00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:35.979
You…

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.481
Darling.

00:55:38.815 --> 00:55:40.484
You like me, don't you?

00:56:01.296 --> 00:56:02.673
Mr. Baek.

00:56:03.548 --> 00:56:04.549
Darling.

00:58:13.637 --> 00:58:16.139
Hey, Seongguk's birthday is…

00:58:16.223 --> 00:58:17.557
Next Saturday.

00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:23.772
How about we take him to Changgyeongwon?

00:58:25.315 --> 00:58:26.691
And show him the elephants.

00:58:26.775 --> 00:58:29.319
Geumji,
we should stop this now.

00:58:30.737 --> 00:58:33.198
Let's go back to the States
with Seongguk, all right?

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.700
I'll do whatever it takes
to raise him well.

00:58:37.786 --> 00:58:39.246
Aren't you angry?

00:58:43.708 --> 00:58:44.709
I am.

00:58:46.753 --> 00:58:47.754
At this world.

00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:12.571
Hey. Get out of the car, punk.

00:59:12.654 --> 00:59:13.989
Who the hell are you?

00:59:14.072 --> 00:59:15.949
- Get out of the car.
- Who the hell are you?

00:59:16.032 --> 00:59:17.534
- Come on.
- Let go! Let go of me!

00:59:17.617 --> 00:59:19.911
- Walk straight, you bastard!
- Who the hell are you?

00:59:19.995 --> 00:59:21.371
- Hey, get him in.
- Hey! Damn it.

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.748
- Get off me!
- Get the hell in!

00:59:38.388 --> 00:59:40.223
What's going on? You scared me.

01:01:09.521 --> 01:01:11.231
Can't you just let me go?

01:01:32.627 --> 01:01:34.796
I wanted to fall in love again.

01:04:10.285 --> 01:04:12.287
