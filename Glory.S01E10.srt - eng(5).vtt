00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.730
[Glory]

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.940
[Episode 10]

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.479
Just now, Lady Yunwan...

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.850
-Come here!
-Come catch us!

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.759
Wanwan, come here!

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.070
Come here! You can't get it!

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.000
Give it to me!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.430
You can't have it!

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.470
At that time, my mother
had just passed away.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.910
The domestic affairs were left unattended.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.760
She was my father's favored concubine

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.160
and had given birth
to Shanchang and Yun'e.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.000
Go on, cry!

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.280
You even caused your own mother's death,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.840
and now I'm stuck with you!

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.120
You want to cry?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.430
I'll make you cry!

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.520
Wanwan hated the Butterfly-Flower
more than anything.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.720
The moment she saw it,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.770
she wanted to tear the villain to shreds,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.530
grind them into mud
and turn them to ashes.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.110
There is one thing
I have never understood.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.750
I would appreciate your guidance,
Lady Shanbao.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.350
What exactly is the Tea Bone?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.630
Back then, the Rong family ancestors

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.960
were the first
to bring tea seeds to Linji.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.870
They taught the local people

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.030
how to grow tea and process tea.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.160
They spared no effort

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.030
to collect precious tea varieties
from far and wide.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.960
They established tea plantations,
promoted tea culture

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.890
and benefited the people of Linji.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.400
Over the centuries that followed,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.400
the Rong family has produced
many renowned tea-making masters.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.520
Among them, those

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.750
with exceptional talent in tea

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.410
are called Tea Bone by people,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.240
earning great respect
from tea farmers everywhere.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.840
We are born knowing nothing.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.470
Even the most talented

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.590
must study hard.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.360
How can there be such a thing
as a natural Tea Bone?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.140
Moreover, if a Tea Bone
can be born in the Rong family,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.840
then they can be

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.520
born in other families too.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.470
Isn't it reckless to pass down this title
based solely on one's family lineage?

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.840
The legend that a Tea Bone is reincarnated
among the common folk

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.800
has been the earnest wish

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.600
of tea farmers for generations.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.079
They long to see the Tea Ancestor
return to this world

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.210
and help people with tea cultivation.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.100
As for why the title
ended up with the Rong family...

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.750
Since ancient times, Emperors
have been called the Sons of Heaven.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.680
Why don't you ask

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.980
if they deserve that lofty title?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.120
Fine.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.480
Then I'll not ask about ancient history.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.540
I'll only focus on the matter at hand.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.480
Lady Shanbao, you already knew

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.190
it was the Lady Yunxi's trap?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Rong Shanchang believed he

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.329
had got something on me,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.600
but in truth,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.960
he was merely bait set by Rong Yunxi.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.500
She could test the waters.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.420
Why couldn't I draw the enemy out?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.300
Lady Yunxi used the Young Master as bait.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.590
And I am

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.310
also your bait, right?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080
Aren't you angry?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.399
Lady Shanbao,
this concerns your life and safety.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.290
You place your trust solely in me
instead of others.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.440
I ought to be glad.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.800
The imperial court holds examinations

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.200
to recruit men of talent,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.950
seeking nothing but

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.960
those who benefit the country
and its people.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.290
As we live in this world,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.690
it's better to be a useful person.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.040
However,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.950
privileges and official posts

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.720
are the Emperor's benevolent efforts
to attract talent.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.170
Lady Shanbao,
if you want to use me in the future,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.630
what will you do to keep me?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.880
Silver has been upgraded to gold.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.290
Lady Shanbao, you truly spare no expense.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.730
But it is not enough.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.560
[Land Deed]

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.310
Gold and silver are merely dead assets.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.570
Farmland and thriving shops
can keep generating profits.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.060
Lady Shanbao,
what you offer is more than sufficient

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.520
to hire me as your steward.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.870
But if you want me

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.870
to keep working my heart out for you,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.770
then it is far from enough.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.170
You don't want gold or silver.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.690
You don't want land deeds or shops.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.380
Then what else do you want?

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.110
How dare you!

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.600
Lady Shanbao, this is your chamber.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.350

was from the bottom of my heart.

I'm here to watch the ceremony.
Is that a problem?

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.600
Mr. Lu, what about you?

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.270
I'm also here to watch the ceremony.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.560
I presume you all know

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.300
my eldest granddaughter

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.630
is of marriageable age.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.090
On this auspicious occasion,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.240
I wish to select

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.270
a handsome and virtuous man

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.480
to be her lifelong partner.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:21.420
Bao.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.340
Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.400
Don't make the wrong choice.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.720
What's going on?

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.770
Has she still not made up her mind?

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.930
What is Yang Dingchen saying?

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.390
Something seems off.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.600
She was so decisive and resolute,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.550
but now she's acting all coy and hesitant.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.360
Ridiculous.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.410
Bao.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.240
Lady Rong Shanbao, congratulations to you

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.970
on your engagement to Mr. Yang.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.480
You're truly

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.150
a perfect match.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.610
What an unexpected union.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.010
Old Madam Rong.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.240
Our He family

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.440
would like to offer the secret recipe
of Huqiu Tea as the betrothal gift

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.100
to marry your granddaughter.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.620
Mr. He...

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.390
Old Madam Rong,
please don't misunderstand me.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.980
I wish to marry

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920
Lady Yunshu.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.550
What? You want to marry Rong Yunshu?

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.960
It's good that you've come
to your senses, Young Master.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.270
The Yan family is rich and powerful.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.840
You could marry any woman you want.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.550
No need to put up with this nonsense.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.150
Let's just

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.970
pack our things and go home now!

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.550
Wait.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.370
[Tea]

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.410
This is the one.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.200
Lady Shanbao has been looking for it
for a long time.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.470
Send it to her.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.640
Young Master,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.040
Lady Shanbao is already engaged
to someone else.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.480
If you're not upset, so be it.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.120
But why aren't you the least bit anxious?

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.240
True mastery lies in apparent clumsiness.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.370
Real wisdom resides in seeming folly.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.480
In my cultivation,
I was too rigid and stubborn,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.410
often too foolish to see the light.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.320
We must understand that success

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.440
comes only through countless trials
and tribulations.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.300
At this moment,

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.190
I suppose someone is more anxious
than I am.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.080
Calm down.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.280
Go now.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.260
How could it be him?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.980
How could it possibly be him?

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.840
He was clearly about

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.120
to be expelled from the Rong Mansion.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.720
Why did Shanbao

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.180
suddenly change her mind?

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.740
Now that Lady Shanbao
has chosen her husband,

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.000
I should pack my things

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.210
and return to the academy soon.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.380
Mr. Bai, please wait.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.750
The Rong family has always been generous.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.670
They would never give others reasons
to criticize them.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.840
Mr. Bai, you've come from afar.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.030
They wouldn't let you leave empty-handed.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.090
The travel expenses
for the imperial examination

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.390
are not that important.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.080
I suppose they're not

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.540
worthy of your attention.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.870
But a letter of recommendation
from Old Madam Rong

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.470
is worth more than ten years
of your hard study.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.280
I was shortsighted.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.080
No harm in staying for the wedding.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.320
Mr. Lu,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.840
no wonder Lady Shanbao
thinks so highly of you.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.080
Your thoughts and considerations are
truly beyond the ken of ordinary people.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.030
I'll speak plainly
even though we're not close.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.090
What I admire most is your composure.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.600
Even if the sky were falling,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.130
you wouldn't bat an eyelid.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.970
You flatter me.
I don't deserve such praise.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.240
I'm going to find Shanbao
and demand an explanation!

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.840

Lady Yunwan,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.680
where are you going?

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.010
Lady Yunwan, it's dangerous here!

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.170
Lady Yunwan.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.480
-Lady Yunwan.
-No!

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.100
I only want Mrs. Liang!

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.200
Lady Yunwan,

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.000
you haven't eaten anything all day.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.870
This is your favorite

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.670
steamed egg custard.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.030
Try a little bit, okay?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360
Just a little bit.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.110
Come on.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.870
No! I don't want her!

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.130
I only want Mrs. Liang!

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.670
Go get Mrs. Liang now!

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.510
I don't want her! I don't want her!

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.960
All right. Calm down.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.360
When did Yunwan

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.110
get a new nanny?

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.940
Lady Yunyin,

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.440
Mrs. Liang,
who used to take care of Lady Yunwan,

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.030
was suddenly hit
by fits of chills and fever,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.200
with nonstop diarrhea.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.030
The physician suspected she had malaria.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.720
Lady Shanbao, fearing the illness
would spread to others,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.240
had Mrs. Liang moved out overnight.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.069
Lady Yunwan

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.440
will also be moved

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.589
to Hualin Courtyard this afternoon.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:18.589
A lunatic!

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:23.839
Lady Yunwan!

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.069
Hurry and take Lady Yunwan back!

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.510
Go now!

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.420
Let's go, Lady Yunwan.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.080
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.480
Which word I said at the ceremony

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.080
was false?

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.190
I didn't falsely accuse you.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.790
I just exposed your tricks
in front of everyone.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.750
The Tea Bone?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.920
You can fool everyone else,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.320
but you can never fool me!

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.520
Is this all you have to say to me?

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.340
Over all these years,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.000
you've made so many mistakes.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.170
I've forgiven you again and again,

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.880
only because Mother, on her deathbed,

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.270
endured all the pain

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.790
to put your hand

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.880
in mine

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.200
and only closed her eyes

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.610
when she saw me nod.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.310
But this time,

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.850
for your own selfish desires,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.440
you've ruined our reputation

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.310
and exposed Wanwan to vicious gossip.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.920
It's my fault for having been too lenient
with you.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.790
From today on,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.190
you are forbidden to go near Wanwan.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.200
If you dare to stir up any more trouble,

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.200
you'll end up like Rong Shanchang.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.930
I could turn him into an outcast.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.910
I can also expel you from the Rong family.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:40.350
You!

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.590
You compare me to that good-for-nothing

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.400
and want to cast me out
of the Rong family.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.640
Who do you think you are?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.240
Grandmother is still alive!

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.830
I dare you to try.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.100
Shanbao! Shanbao!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.600
Lady Shanbao, Mr. Wen is...

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.380
Shanbao,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.090
I have something important to ask you.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:09.860
What a sick joke!

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.330
I don't want to be your sister at all!

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.640
If I had had a choice,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.640
I'd have chosen to be born
into the Second Branch

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.420
and have Yunxi as my real sister.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.620
She would have been far better than you!

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.920
She's been influenced by her stepmother's
instigation since childhood,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.380
despising Wanwan deeply.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.350
Coaxed and deceived
by Yunxi and the others,

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.780
she has grown attached to them

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.480
and treated you as her enemy instead.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.070
She's the most foolish one
in the Rong Mansion.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.330
Don't take it to heart.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.400
I don't blame anyone else.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.880
It's the fault
of her own foolish stubbornness.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.090
Why are you in such a hurry to see me?

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.050
Today at the ceremony,
when you chose your future husband,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.110
why did you...

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.140
-Why?
-Wen!

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.200
On your first day here,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.730
I made everything clear to you.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.040
You're gentle and indecisive,

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.160
not cut out to be my future husband.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.310
It would be wiser
to seek your match elsewhere.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.070
My marriage

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.080
is none of your concern.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.510
Manzhu, show him out.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.160
Anyone else would have been acceptable.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.000
Anyone else in Xinfang Pavilion

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.330
would have been better.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.030
Why did you

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.160
have to choose Yang?

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.910
He is vile and unscrupulous.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.790
In the martial arts arena,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.050
he tried to destroy others at every turn.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.870
You saw it all with your own eyes.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.280
Why did you still choose him?

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.720
No. Something's not right.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.050
You must have some hidden reason.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.790
If you tell me everything honestly,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.110
perhaps I can help solve your problem.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.830
If you don't tell me the truth,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.890
I won't leave here!

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.030
When I set my mind against something,

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.490
no one in this world
could ever talk me round.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.300
I chose Yang Dingchen myself.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.590
I can bear all the consequences.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.030
Fine. If you don't leave,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.880
then I'll leave.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.880
Shanbao!

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.450
Mr. Wen! Mr. Wen!

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:13.980
Bao.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.600
You know Lady Shanbao's temper.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.000
Don't make things worse.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.070
Why?

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.440
Why did you choose him?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.340
Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.110
Don't make the wrong choice.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.960
Lady Shanbao.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:17.620
Come on.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.050
Plant this row of flowers over there.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.510
This row, plant it over there.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.110
All right.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.740
Plant a few more.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.460
No problem.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.380
Jun Dai, get a few more hands over here.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:38.860
Okay.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.930
Move all those flowers over there.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.380
Lady Shanbao.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.550
What are you all up to?

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.680
I saw this place was littered
with dead branches

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.750
and overgrown with weeds,

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.030
so I brought some people
to weed the garden.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.030
You know nothing!

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.030
Lady Shanbao deliberately

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.310
had us leave it untouched

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.510
so that it would grow naturally

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.240
and become authentic wild tea.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.290
Sorry that I overstepped.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.930
Please forgive me, Lady Shanbao.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.130
What made you think of planting these?

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.510
Don't stop. Continue planting.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.720
The other day I went to the tea plantation
on the mountain.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.050
I happened
to hear the old tea master mention

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:40.790
that you once

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.790
set a strict rule.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.920
Before processing tea, one must bathe
and change into clean clothes.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.590
They must also
wash their hands thoroughly 3 times

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.380
before entering the tea plantation.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.550
This is to prevent any body odor

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.400
from mingling with the tea's fragrance.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.640
Tea bushes are planted
all over the Rong family courtyard.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.480
But only here

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.080
stands a magnolia tree.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.920
There are pines to the east

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.750
and sweet osmanthus trees to the west.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.270
I suppose that since you know
how to ward off unwanted smells,

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.470
you must be even better
at incorporating desirable ones.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:32.080

don't hesitate to call on me.

Done.

Follow me.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.380
Mr. Yang, what is the meaning of this?

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.000
I know the Rong family

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.020
handles marriages differently,

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.010
skipping all those

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.610
lengthy betrothal formalities.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.540
Yet a marriage joins two families.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.360
It must not be treated lightly.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.800
I have brought some small gifts
as a token of my sincerity.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.350
Go inside and announce my arrival.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.350
Just tell them...

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.960
Just go and do as I say.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.940
The wedding date has not yet been set.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.180
My young master

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.960
has specifically come today

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.760
to seek Lady Shanbao's opinion.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.350
Mr. Yang, you've come
at an inopportune time.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.070
Lady Shanbao has just

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.070
left the mansion.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.860
Who did she go out with?

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.270
I suspect she's deliberately avoiding me.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.750
Then I'll go inside and wait.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.260
Let's go inside.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:53.880
Mr. Yang.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:55.660
Mr. Yang.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.210
I am Lady Shanbao's fiancé!

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.130
Who dares to stand in my way?

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.550
Well, well!

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.010
After all that picking and choosing,
she got herself a hothead.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.820
This is going to be fun.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.070
Lady Shanbao,

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.160
the low-yield plantation

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.960
is just ahead.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.460
Among this year's
first spring tea harvest,

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.030
its tea is of the poorest quality.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.350
I had my men follow the usual practice

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.680
of applying more fertilizer
and doing pest control,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.810
but nothing worked.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.180
Lady Shanbao, today you're here

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.910
to treat the ailing tea plants?

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.350
This was the first tea plantation

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.680
I took over when I was 13.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.950
Come with me. I'll show you around.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:48.590
Lady Shanbao.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.070
Old Madam Rong heard

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.550
about the poor harvest
in the old tea plantations

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.350
this year.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.900
She specifically invited Mr. Yan to come

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.480
to help you take a look.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.380
Old Madam Rong was joking.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.480
Lady Shanbao, your expertise in tea

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.690
is well known to everyone.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.200
I wouldn't dare to show off
in front of an expert

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.600
and make a fool of myself.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.680
I am merely here to observe and learn.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.310
Mr. Yan, you arrived here early.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.440
What have you found?

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.280
I've just taken a look around.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.110
And I have a couple of thoughts.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:22.840
The tea plants here are too old,

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.680
and their buds are poorly developed.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.480
Lady Shanbao,

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.350
we have tended to this place
with great care.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.550
We've also transplanted
many new tea plants

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.640
to replace the dead ones.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.440
But for some reason,

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.920
they just won't grow properly.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.070
It's simply because years of rain erosion

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.590
have depleted the soil's fertility.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.720
That's why the old tea plants
are withering and dying,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.180
and the new ones
are prematurely declining.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.130
Look at this one.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.290
The branches are ashen,

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.360
covered in overgrown moss.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.760
How could it possibly flourish?

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.410
And this one is in even worse shape.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.310
The roots are exposed above the ground.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.640
No matter how much fertilizer you apply,

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.040
it's just not enough
to make up for the loss.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.880
A sick tea plant is like a sick person.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.720
Each requires its own prescription.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.110
No matter how dedicated
the tea workers are,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.910
they don't have such expertise.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.600
There's no need to blame them.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.080
That makes perfect sense.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.350
I originally intended to have stone ridges

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.030
built along the mountain slopes,

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.690
with some sandy soil added in.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.590
But there's too much work
in the tea plantations now.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.000
We simply can't spare the manpower.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.720
No need to go through all that trouble.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.050
Why not just use local materials instead?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.030
In the past, I often saw the masters
on the mountain

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.240
make use of cut grass
and fallen branches.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.840
Why don't we give it a try too?

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.270
I believe

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.350
the tea plants in this plantation

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.480
will grow well soon.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.830
As the old saying goes,

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.640
birds of a feather flock together.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.240
A person's virtue lies
in knowing their place.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.960
Pigs will never fly.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.640
They may inflate themselves

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.840
with all their might,

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.170
but the sky won't come any closer.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.280
So I'd advise some people

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.310
to stop overestimating
their own abilities.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.470
You seem quite
aware of your limited abilities.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.950
You!

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.770
Lady Shanbao.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.430
I...

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.760
Lady Shanbao.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.900
On our way up the mountain,

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.980
Yi was worrying

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.270
that today we wouldn't make it

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.640
to the new plantation on the back hill.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.160
Fortunately, with Mr. Yan in charge here,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.400
we're free to go now.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.680
You have a point.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.200
Yi.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.630
Grandmother has invited Mr. Yan
to offer guidance.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.240
No matter how tricky
your tea problems are,

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.170
with him around,

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.180
they'll all be sorted out smoothly.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:27.860
Mr. Yan.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.150
During the reclamation
of the back hill wilderness,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.550
we ran into some problems.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.000
I have to go there myself.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.210
I'm leaving this in your hands.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.500
Steward Cheng.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:37.630
Lady Shanbao.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.720
You stay here.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.290
Just follow Mr. Yan's orders.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.640
Don't act on your own.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.910
Lady Shanbao.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.680
The path to the back hill is rather rough.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.920
Why not let Yi stay here?

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.070
I'll accompany you instead.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.440
That won't be necessary.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.880
Yi, lead the way.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:54.880
Yes.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.440
Sorry to leave you with this, Mr. Yan.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.700
I'll take my leave now.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.440
Young Master,
you came here for Lady Shanbao,

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.370
but Lu Fusheng ruined everything.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.380
Is he a tea expert?

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.350
Or is he a tea physician?

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.110
Why on earth does he need to tag along?

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.680
Shixin,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.250
don't speak out of turn.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.970
Steward Cheng.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.750
Just now I noticed Lady Shanbao

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.880
looked quite tired.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.830
She must have been jostled by the journey

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.160
in that light carriage.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.960
My carriage is rather spacious
and comfortable.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.920
Please have someone inform Lady Shanbao

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.180
that she can use mine for the return trip.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.150
I'll be waiting
at the foot of the mountain at 3 p.m.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.350
Yes.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.520
Lady Shanbao,

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.310
it's not that they are unwilling
to work hard.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.740
With the spring harvest in full swing,

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.720
we can't spare many hands

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.510
right now.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.200
Fertilizing is the top priority.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.880
Get them to do shallow ploughing first.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.810
Then hurry up and dig trenches
to apply fertilizer.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.240
We need
to build up the soil's fertility first.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.830
We can do the deeper ploughing next month
when things ease up.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:14.620
Don't worry, Lady Shanbao.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.020
I understand all of this.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:29.590
Be careful!

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.100
Is Lady Shanbao all right?

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.310
Thank goodness no one was hurt.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.840
Are you okay, Lady Shanbao?

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.030
Lady Shanbao.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.720
Lady Shanbao, are you all right?

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.310
Watch where you're going!

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.420
Are those eyes just for decoration?

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.630
Why not just gouge them out
and add them to the compost?

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.540
Yi, I'm sorry.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.070
Please don't be angry, Lady Shanbao.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.480
I must have been out of my mind.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.000
So...

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.640
Alright, you've worked all day

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.720
and must be tired.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.000
I've asked Manzhu
to prepare some herbal tea and pastries.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.330
Take a break, everyone.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.590
Thank you, Lady Shanbao.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.650
Get out of here!

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.480
You were quick on your feet.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.240
Are you hurt?

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.960
Lady Shanbao, it's getting late.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.820
Mr. Yan is still waiting
at the foot of the mountain.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:15.429
Right, right!

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.880
We mustn't keep Mr. Yan
waiting a moment longer.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.480
Let's go.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.590
Did you twist your ankle?

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.520
I was fine standing still just now,

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.760
but when I moved,

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.449
I think... I think it's broken.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.370
Don't worry, Lady Shanbao.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:38.480
I'm fine.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.000
It won't kill me.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.150
You should go now.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.530
Steward Cheng.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.480
Have you sent someone to ask Lady Shanbao?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.360
Mr. Yan, I wouldn't dare
to keep you waiting in vain.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.030
Lady Shanbao has certainly agreed to come.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.690
She'll probably be here soon.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.630
Mr. Yan!

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.550
Mr. Yan!

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.070
Mr. Yan!

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.630
Mr. Yan,

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.150
Lady Shanbao was planning to come down,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.920
but Mr. Lu unfortunately
sprained his ankle,

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.720
holding us up.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.880
So she asked you to return first.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.310
Steward Cheng, Lady Shanbao ordered you

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.530
to quickly find a sedan chair

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.890
to carry Mr. Lu down the mountain

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:29.890
and take him

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.000
to Woodcutter Wang for treatment.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.440
His family's secret recipe
for bruises and sprains

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.150
is the most effective.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.350
It works like a charm.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.820
Are you deaf? Go now.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.360
Mr. Yan.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.440
Lady Shanbao has asked you
to renturn first.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.900
You'd better head off now.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.690
Did Lady Shanbao get hurt?

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.930
Take me to her immediately.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:53.930
All right.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.630
Let's go back.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.480
Few of those suitors at the Rong Mansion

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.630
stand a chance.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.280
But you and Lady Shanbao

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.480
just hit it off.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.960
You're a perfect match

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.360
with the same interests.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.670
If Lady Shanbao
doesn't marry her soulmate,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.920
then who else could she possibly marry?

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.610
But Lu Fusheng
came to mess things up.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.070
He was deliberately causing trouble
just now.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:18.800
This has happened several times.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.750
And you're still tolerating him?

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.310
Shut up.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760
Since when

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.150
did I teach you

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.510
to gossip

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.400
and backbite?

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.760
I was just

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.070
standing up for you, Young Master.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.400
He was taking advantage of your kindness.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.120
What's going on?

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.070
Young Master,

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:39.960
the wheel got stuck in a pit

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.840
and was knocked against a rock,

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.550
cracking a seam. We can't pry it out.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.360
It's getting dark soon.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.440
Figure something out!

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:44.880
Yes.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.350
Go.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.650
Push harder.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.490
Is that Mr. Yan over there?

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.950
I'm heading back to the mansion too.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.410
If you don't mind, Mr. Yan,

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.580
please join me in my carriage.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.430
Thank you for your kind offer, Lady Yunxi.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:20.620
But men and women

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.350
should keep a proper distance.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.670
I have never shared a carriage
with a woman,

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.800
just to avoid unnecessary gossip

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.530
and trouble.

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:27.960
I have already sent someone

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.620
to the village ahead for help.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.200
Please continue your journey, Lady Yunxi.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.190
It's getting dark.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.590
I'm afraid
you'll have a long wait, Mr. Yan.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.030
You might be hungry.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.320
Let my maid offer you some pastries.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.270
You wouldn't refuse even this, would you?

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.230
Thank you for your concern, Lady Yunxi.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.230
I've already eaten on the mountain.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.000
Oh my goodness!

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.070
Mr. Yan, you guard your reputation
so carefully,

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.670
avoiding me like the plague,

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.030
as if I were some venomous creature.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.680
I wonder if she appreciates your devotion.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.550
Be careful, Mr. Yan.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.150
It takes two to tango.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.100
Don't let all your efforts end up in vain.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:22.240
Let's go.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200
How ungrateful.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:38.350
Young Master,

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.840
Lady Yunxi was only trying to be kind.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.320
Why did you push her away so coldly?

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.280
Wouldn't it be better
to ride back with her

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.210
in her carriage?

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.630
I should've let you

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.150
starve to death by the roadside.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.150
It would've been better
than ending up with you annoying me.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:50.150
Go find someone to help us right now.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:51.360
You just keep waiting and wishing.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.400
You can wait till the cows come home

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:52.920
and see if Lady Shanbao

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.050
spares you a glance.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.780
Fine, fine! I'm going now!

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.510
Old Madam Rong has sent Nianqiao

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.670
to inquire twice already.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:28.840
And that Mr. Yang...

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.690
He refused to leave Qilan Garden.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.330
The servants were afraid,

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.200
not daring to send him away.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.240
Let's go to Chongxi Hall first.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.450
Steward Cheng.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.670
Yes.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.150
You personally send Fusheng

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.400
back to Xinfang Pavilion.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.800
And take good care of him.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.870
Yes.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.360
Help Steward Lu out of the sedan chair.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.920
Steward Lu, please.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.650
I am hardly worthy

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.070
of such kindness from Lady Shanbao.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.390
Steward Cheng, sorry to trouble you

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.050
to take care of me personally.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.430
Thank you.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.660
Yang Dingchen is not someone
to be messed with.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.790
We'll see how long you can keep this up.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.740
With your limited abilities,

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.170
all you can do is watch

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.400
from the sidelines.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.610
Young Master, watch your step.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.590
Everyone may leave now.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.070
Yes.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.400
Grandmother.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.590
You've agreed
to the Yang family's proposal.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.660
Originally, I didn't want
to go against your wish.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.800
However, the Rong and Yan families

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.310
have had a marriage alliance
for generations.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.870
Yan Bailou is of noble character

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.300
and exceptional talent.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.290
Giving up such a fine man

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:45.110
is truly like

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.770
trading jade for common rock.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.360
If you were a man,

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.640
I would arrange for you to have both.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.550
One would be your wife,
and the other your concubine.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.010
That would be convenient.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.550
But you are a woman,

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.320
so you must keep your eyes open

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.010
and carefully choose the best one.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.000
I've worked hard
to create opportunities for you,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.520
yet you cast him aside.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.950
This is nonsense.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:08.710
Grandmother, you have such keen insight.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.400
You've always been
a good judge of character.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.190
I could never match you in that regard.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.510
Mr. Yan is truly outstanding

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:14.710
and beyond reproach.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.480
But I publicly accepted
the Yang family's proposal.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.960
It would be truly improper
to go back on my word.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.840
Don't lie to me.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.660
For that useless mother of yours,

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.470
you've sacrificed a lot.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.190
But she just closed her eyes

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.150
and left the world,

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.840
passing her chaos down to you.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.280
How long will you keep

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.970
cleaning up the mess she left behind?

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.280
A Rong daughter's choice of husband

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.010
has always been her own to make.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.690
Grandmother, I beg you
to grant me this wish.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.630
This is indeed the old family

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.550
tradition.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.730
But when young people
stray from the right path,

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.460
their elders must set them straight!

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.890
I am determined to see this match through.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.110
You have several younger sisters

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.240
who have come of age.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.850
Surely one
more considerate and filial than you

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.710
will cherish my good intentions.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.800
But let me be clear.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.760
Once such a precedent is set,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.860
no one can restrain what follows.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.550
Others will shoulder burdens
meant for you,

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.290
and the family

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.030
will inevitably be torn apart
by disputes and fights.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.260
When that time comes,

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.320
I will no longer be able

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.470
to speak up for you.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.400
[Herbal Tea]

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.600
Young Master.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.630
This...

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.510
The servants are too slack and lazy.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.600
The teapot is completely empty.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:31.560
I'll fetch another pot of tea right away.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.230
[Lord Lu is in a bad mood.]

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.900
[How about a cup of herbal tea
to calm down?]

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:36.880
When it comes to herbal tea,

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.240
it's certainly no stranger to most people.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.070
Especially in today's
Guangdong and Guangxi,

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.440
herbal tea is the top-selling

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.630
summer drink.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:44.760
The origin of herbal tea

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.840
is closely related
to traditional Chinese medicine

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.040
and the region's humid and hot climate.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.710
Since ancient times, the Lingnan region
has been rife with miasma.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:50.670
Intense humidity and heat interact,

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:51.980
easily inducing internal heat.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.930
The ancient locals

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.360
decocted medicinal herbs into drinks,

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.590
which are used to clear heat,
detoxify

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.690
and balance one's body constitution.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.390
The herbal tea culture embodies the wisdom

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:00.790
of preventive medicine in TCM,

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:02.430
emphasizing natural regulation.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:03.980
Recipes often combine
dozens of medicinal herbs

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.630
such as honeysuckle and selfheal spike.

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:06.790
It not only relieves summer heat
and dispels dampness,

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.270
but also has been deeply integrated
into the daily life of the local people.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.270
In 2006,

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.590
the art of making herbal tea

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.110
was listed as a national
intangible cultural heritage,

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:12.480
becoming

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.430
a symbol of Chinese wellness culture.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.910
Today,

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.880
herbal tea has become

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.280
a carrier of nostalgia
for overseas Chinese.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.510
In the modern context,

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.190
new variants

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:21.330
such as sugar-free and fruit-flavored
versions have also emerged.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.150
Yet its core essence remains deeply rooted

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.190
in the traditional wisdom
of harmony between humans and nature,

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:26.550
becoming a lifestyle

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.710
that has persisted for millennia.
