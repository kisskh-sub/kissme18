=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.212
=Episode 9=
(Feasting Together, Yet Hearts Hide Dark Designs)

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.120
Just past midnight last night,

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.279
they were all strangled to death.

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:26.440
Each killed by the other's hands.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.720
It defies common sense.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.760
The human world is vast.

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.839
There is much you have yet
to see or understand.

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:34.599
Know when to stop,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.080
and you may live longer for it.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.400
Clean this up.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.360
Then send the bodies
to the charity morgue.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.990
If you said the brothers turned on
each other, I could believe that.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.120
But if there was truly a confrontation,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.839
how could there have been
no noise at all?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.399
To kill without alerting the guards,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.119
the murderer must be highly skilled.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.260
And with the fire
at the Document Building,

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.880
someone is trying to stop us
from digging further.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.919
Sir.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.279
Someone delivered this.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.800
An invitation?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.225
(Invitation)

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.399
The twenty-second, at mid morning.

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:32.880
Flowers in full bloom,
birds vying in song.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.600
Inviting neighbors to share a seat,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.390
calling across the fence
to finish the wine.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.039
Luofu Manor beyond the city walls.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.639
(Zhao Chengxi)
My home is swept clean, awaiting your presence.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.080
Zhao Chengxi.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.320
The man who once paid for fake heads,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.720
Zhao Chengxi, the influential magnate.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.759
He is the one you are after.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.919
(So you are finally
stepping into the light.)

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.839
Sir.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.559
All the invitations have been sent?

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.119
Yes.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.000
Every last one.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.260
Everyone knows my wife suffers
from sudden bouts of madness.

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.600
Using her as the blade

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:09.759
to remove them

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.559
leaves no trace behind.

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.199
To cross us like this

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.360
means they are far too bold
for their own good.

00:03:18.687 --> 00:03:20.312
(Luofu Manor)

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.600
(Luofu Manor)
I arrive with my household

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.199
to accept Mr. Zhao's invitation.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.600
Master Lu, please come inside.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.800
(Luofu Manor)

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:00.759
Here they come.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.119
(Fated Apart, Zhao Chengxi)
Master Lu, thank you for sparing the time to attend.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.740
Your presence
truly honors my humble home.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.479
(Purplish spots inside the lips.)

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.800
(He appears to be suffering
from severe poisoning.)

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:13.039
Mr. Zhao.

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.519
This is Sir Zhai
from the prefectural office.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.000
We have met before.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.440
Inspecting Envoy.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.239
The former magistrate
of Huachang County.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.239
(Yu Prefecture Inspecting Envoy)
Mr. Zhao, you certainly have influence.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:25.812
(Former Huachang County Magistrate Zhai Lu)

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.160
I know him.

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:35.119
Zhai Lu.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.320
The Thrush Case
was handled under his watch,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320
and hastily closed.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.480
An incompetent official.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.279
So or later,
I will settle accounts with him.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.320
Isn't this Master Lu
who once wrote verses

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.720
at Tunhai House
to mock the Grand Chancellor?

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:49.959
Allow me a word of advice.

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:52.720
This is not the capital.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.320
Those unruly habits of yours, Master Lu,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.320
best not surface here.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.160
If you fall into my hands,

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.720
the ending may not be a pleasant one.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.959
Could the information I bought be wrong?

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:11.239
What exactly did you write
at Tunhai House?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.920
I'll tell you later.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.320
This must be your wife.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.760
Indeed.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.359
Truly elegant and refined.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.880
My wife is entertaining
the families inside.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.720
Shall I have a maid escort you there?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.600
Very well.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.440
This way, young lady.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.239
Proceed with care.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.640
Master Lu.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.600
Please.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.880
Young lady,
please wait here for a moment.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.799
(Mo Feibai?)

00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.399
(If it truly is that Mo Feibai
from back then,)

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.799
(he should be thirteen
or fourteen by now.)

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.679
(How could he possibly be here?)

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:19.962
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:35.959
You finally showed up.
You deserve to die most of all.

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:38.040
Mrs. Zhao.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.559
Young lady.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.760
Madam.

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:42.320
Young lady.

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.760
Madam.

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:45.000
(Zhao Chengxi's wife, Mrs. Zhao)
Let go of my lady, you madwoman.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:46.399
(Zhao Chengxi's wife, Mrs. Zhao)
Let go. Let go.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.079
Let go.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.079
Please calm down, Madam.

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.839
Let go!

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.320
Mrs. Zhao.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.799
Is this how Luofu Manor
treats its guests?

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.799
Get out of here.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.440
Get out!

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.839
Dear.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.160
I was told there was some friction

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.679
between you and Ms. Li.

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:17.640
Friction?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.640
Your maids saw it clearly.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.320
Your wife was plainly trying
to kill someone.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.820
A misunderstanding.
All of it is a misunderstanding.

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.720
My wife has been gravely ill of late,
her mind not entirely clear.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.920
She offended our honored guest.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.140
I will first escort my wife
back to her room to rest.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.900
At the banquet tonight,
we will make amends.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.679
How is it?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.540
Does it hurt?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.119
I just saw Mo Feibai.

00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:51.760
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)
Things have grown complicated.

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:55.430
Zhao Chengxi is connected to people
under Master Jiang's protection.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.720
When the Thrush Case occurred,

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.399
he was in the north trading ginseng.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:59.960
No one expected he was the one

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.990
who bribed the Huang brothers
to supply fake heads.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.160
Mo Feibai was supposed to be

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.850
the key evidence
found beside the victims.

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.720
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)
Now that it has surfaced in the Zhao residence,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.839
it directly ties Zhao Chengxi
to the murders.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.839
As for Zhao Chengxi's wife,
no one knows what has possessed her.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.990
She keeps targeting you.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.760
The maids in the manor say

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.440
their mistress has episodes of madness.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.910
And then there is Zhai Lu,
who showed up here for no clear reason,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.500
doing nothing but making trouble for me.

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:24.720
In my view,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.480
hesitating only lets others
hold us back.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.399
A sudden move may be the way through.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.800
And how do you plan to break it?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.159
Steal the thrush.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.400
When?

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:38.719
After nightfall,

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:40.760
before the banquet begins.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.100
The banquet starts at 7:30.

00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:50.559
We have roughly half an hour.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.880
Yexin and Huiyi
learned my ventriloquism.

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:54.190
They will stay in the room

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.890
to keep outsiders
from getting suspicious.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:03.919
Yuan.

00:09:04.359 --> 00:09:05.599
Are you still feeling unwell?

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:07.719
As long as you stay here with me,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.320
I feel perfectly fine.

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:11.640
Did today frighten you?

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:13.560
Have some more tea to calm yourself.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.310
There's movement over there.
Let's go take a look.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.660
Alright.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.640
(Ji)
(Li Ji's seal.)

00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:12.080
(It is actually here.)

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.080
You are finally awake.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.919
Today, I will kill you,

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.239
and use your blood as an offering

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:16.159
to the wronged souls crying out below.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.760
One walks first down the road
to the underworld,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.799
the living are left
to drink grief alone.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:25.320
If you die,

00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:26.840
how heartbroken

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.960
will Magistrate Lu be?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.960
I am not my brother's shadow,

00:11:32.599 --> 00:11:34.239
nor am I Master Lu's weakness.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.119
I do this for no one.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.980
First and foremost, I do it for myself,

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.520
for the blood-soaked path
I have walked these thirteen years,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.919
for the suffering
I have endured these thirteen years.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.960
Are you any different,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.599
Mrs. Shen?

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:52.890
I once found a book called
Spring Food Records in the small tower.

00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:53.562
(Spring Food Records)

00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:55.039
In the corner was the character Jin,

00:11:55.239 --> 00:11:56.280
as if it were a signature.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.039
Back then,
the Thrush Case shocked everyone.

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:00.239
The victim was Shen Xiu.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:01.919
His wife was from the Shang family.

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:03.440
(Jin)
Her given name

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:05.039
was also Jin.

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:06.440
What a coincidence.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.200
Isn't it?

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.119
This is indeed that same thrush.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.200
It's only a lookalike bought
from the bird market.

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:20.400
Now,

00:12:20.599 --> 00:12:21.559
since someone

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:23.719
has taken an interest in this thrush,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.640
it must be tied to the old case.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.679
Can your wife really go through with it?

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.559
If anything goes wrong,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.719
you know the consequences.

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:35.080
Yes.

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:54.760
Li Ji's sister
will not last much longer.

00:12:55.479 --> 00:12:56.679
Next, it will be your turn.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.080
You know her true identity.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.760
It was your husband, Zhao Chengxi,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.119
who led you here to kill her.

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:08.400
What if your husband has deceived you?

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:11.760
Shang Jin.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.520
Do not let villains
mislead you and use you.
