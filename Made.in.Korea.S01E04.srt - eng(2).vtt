WEBVTT

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.331
Methamphetamine. Philopon.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:19.374
Street name, meth.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.753
This wonder drug keeps you awake
and erases fear,

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:25.631
practically sending you into euphoria.

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.966
It was born during the war.

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:34.681
Soldiers high on it charged
into enemy lines without fear,

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:37.100
and it was used to force

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:40.145
conscripted laborers
into endless nights of work.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.732
The real problem began after the war.

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:48.195
When liberation came
and men returned home to their families,

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:50.781
they were no longer the same.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.623
A boy who had longed to see
his father again

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:04.044
was struck with fear at the sight of a man
he no longer recognized.

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:11.301
No wonder.

00:01:12.427 --> 00:01:15.764
His father had come back as a meth addict.

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:19.726
Stop! Stop it!

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:23.397
Stop!

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:32.781
Jesus Christ.
What happened here?

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:34.783
Oh, it's their son.

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:37.077
- That's terrible.
- Good grief.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.315
The name of the man who got
addicted to meth and killed his wife is

00:02:08.275 --> 00:02:09.568
Jang Myeongho.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:11.403
My father.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.550
Here, have some.

00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:19.846
When I was little, my father
would often bring home red bean buns.

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:26.102
I got tired of them
and said I wanted something else.

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:29.356
But he kept bringing red bean buns.

00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:32.275
It wasn't until later that I realized

00:03:33.068 --> 00:03:35.237
they were my mother's favorite.

00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:43.662
He wasn't buying the buns

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:46.998
for me, but for her.

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:51.086
How's your mom?

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:54.089
Is she doing well?

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.051
That damn woman.

00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:01.972
She's not cheating on me, is she?

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.520
Next time,

00:04:09.813 --> 00:04:11.565
make sure you bring her.

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:15.151
Ever since he killed my mother,

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:18.029
he has been locked away
in a mental hospital.

00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:22.784
Completely unaware of what he did…

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:26.246
he still asks for her.

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:41.094
Hyeeun!

00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:42.804
Come here.

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:44.931
Come on, quick.

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:46.850
Your brother's here.

00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:48.560
- My brother?
- Yeah, go on.

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.479
Come on, people. Pick up the pace!

00:04:51.563 --> 00:04:53.398
You want to miss today's quota?

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:00.196
How have you been?

00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:02.449
You know, same old.

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:05.201
I guess things will get better with time.

00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:09.581
Oh, right.

00:05:09.664 --> 00:05:11.499
Are you getting any better at guitar?

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:13.793
Wait, how do you know about that?

00:05:13.877 --> 00:05:15.253
How would I know?

00:05:15.754 --> 00:05:17.297
You told me about it last time.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.924
Oh…

00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:20.592
Did I?

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:22.135
So, getting better?

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:23.720
No.

00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:25.764
Not really.

00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:31.311
Why don't you play something?
There's a guitar.

00:05:31.394 --> 00:05:32.395
What?

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.231
No, I don't want to. It's embarrassing.

00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:37.233
What's embarrassing?

00:05:37.317 --> 00:05:38.318
Give it a try.

00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:40.862
But…

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:43.031
Let's see what you can do on the guitar.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.994
Even if it's bad, don't make fun of me.

00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:49.537
Why would I make fun of you?

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:09.224

IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER

00:06:51.182 --> 00:06:53.143
Prosecutor,
your sentencing recommendation.

00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:56.604
The defendants, Robert Blunt

00:06:57.814 --> 00:07:00.859
and Jimmy Walters,
entered the residence of the victims,

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:06.072
Kim Taeyeong and Lee Suni,
on March 2, 1970,

00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:09.075
at approximately 7:30 p.m.

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:11.536
In the course
of demanding methamphetamine,

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:14.664
they brutally murdered the victims.

00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:17.167
The knife and other evidence

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.669
recovered at the horrific crime scene

00:07:19.753 --> 00:07:22.547
clearly establish their intent to kill

00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:26.843
during the commission of the offense.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.766
Therefore, in order
to heighten society's vigilance

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:35.518
against the dangers
of narcotics addiction,

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:39.856
the Prosecution submits the defendants
bear full criminal responsibility.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.942
For the defendants,

00:07:44.027 --> 00:07:45.528
Robert Blunt

00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:47.697
and…

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:50.909
Jimmy Walters,

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:54.329
the Prosecution seeks a death sentence.

00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:02.003
How long?

00:08:02.086 --> 00:08:04.672
Five? Five years? Ten?

00:08:04.756 --> 00:08:06.633
Order in the court!

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:14.349
INDICTMENT

00:08:15.308 --> 00:08:18.311
The death penalty?

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:19.896
THE PROSECUTION WALKING
THE STRAIGHT PATH…

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:22.607
I thought you promised
to reduce their sentences!

00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:26.194
That's why the Yanks cooperated
with the investigation!

00:08:26.778 --> 00:08:28.238
"The Prosecution,

00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:30.448
walking the straight path,
upholding principle."

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:34.577
I never promised.
I said I would consider it.

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:36.704
They deserve the death penalty.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.958
The victims were brutally murdered
with slit throats.

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.168
And Lee Suni was pregnant.

00:08:42.252 --> 00:08:44.170
I know. I get it.

00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:47.006
You think
the Americans will just sit back?

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.218
- What about US-Korea relations?
- Well…

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:52.679
As I understand it,

00:08:52.762 --> 00:08:56.724
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
is paying very close attention to that.

00:08:57.267 --> 00:09:01.354
And I heard the US just set up
a federal agency called

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:04.357
the Drug Enforcement Administration
on the president's orders.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.570
So why don't we make
something like that too, sir?

00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:11.656
If you recommend it
to the Prosecutor General,

00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:15.827
and he raises it with the President,
it could happen.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.453
What have you been up to lately?

00:09:17.537 --> 00:09:19.289
Why are you never at your desk?

00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:21.916
Well, I'm doing
what I've always been doing, sir.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.543
Yeah, so what is it?

00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:27.046
-My job.
-Which is?

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.840
Catching criminals.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.134
You know, my job.

00:09:34.596 --> 00:09:36.514
If you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.141
Hey,

00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:40.310
I'm warning you again.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.229
Don't go stirring up the KCIA.

00:09:43.313 --> 00:09:48.193
Well, as long as they're not
tangled up in drugs,

00:09:48.902 --> 00:09:50.320
I have no reason to.

00:09:53.698 --> 00:09:55.033
I'll be going now, sir.

00:09:56.201 --> 00:09:58.203
That nutjob.

00:10:01.122 --> 00:10:02.332
What about the notebook?

00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:04.125
There was no notebook.

00:10:07.795 --> 00:10:08.796
No notebook?

00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:10.632
No.

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:13.593
She said it never existed
in the first place.

00:10:22.602 --> 00:10:24.687
That crazy bitch.

00:10:26.522 --> 00:10:29.234
She pulled all that shit
when there wasn't even a notebook?

00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:31.986
Right?

00:10:36.032 --> 00:10:38.284
You were colluding
with Bae Geumji, weren't you?

00:10:44.624 --> 00:10:46.751
That's why you went to Japan with her,

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:50.380
and why you met Choi Yuji?

00:10:55.802 --> 00:10:57.971
You plotted it since the time…

00:10:58.054 --> 00:10:59.722
…you stopped me
from killing Kang Daeil, right?

00:11:14.404 --> 00:11:17.448
Hey. You run a goddamn department
at the KCIA.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.368
And you're pushing drugs?

00:11:22.328 --> 00:11:23.329
Huh?

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.919
What will people say if they find out?

00:11:30.003 --> 00:11:31.587
You little shit!

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.383
Hey.

00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:37.677
Did you think I wouldn't know?

00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:41.973
You tried to fool me?

00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:44.267
How dare you!

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.603
- Oh? Oh?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry, sir!

00:11:48.688 --> 00:11:49.731
Get off me.

00:11:50.982 --> 00:11:52.567
Please give me one more chance!

00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:55.987
And my life is yours.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.697
You goddamn piece of shit.

00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:00.575
How about 200 million?

00:12:01.326 --> 00:12:04.120
I'll give you 200 million every month.

00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:05.913
You must have an insane death wish.

00:12:05.997 --> 00:12:06.998
Hey.

00:12:07.582 --> 00:12:10.084
If anyone finds out,
we're both dead, you asshole.

00:12:10.585 --> 00:12:11.836
That'll never happen.

00:12:12.628 --> 00:12:16.257
Even if something were to go wrong,
we just need to get rid of Kang Daeil.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.218
Sir, it's 200 million every month!

00:12:20.053 --> 00:12:22.472
We could make even more down the line!

00:12:23.765 --> 00:12:26.976
You don't want to spend your whole life
groveling to Chief Cheon, do you?

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.394
What did you just say?

00:12:28.478 --> 00:12:32.774
I swear I'll do whatever it takes
to put you in the Blue House, sir.

00:12:40.281 --> 00:12:41.741
Make it 300 million.

00:12:43.117 --> 00:12:44.619
Three hundred million every month.

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:47.663
If you can't do it,

00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:50.583
then just die.

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:10.186
You snitched, didn't you?
You fucking bastard!

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:13.773
Hey, what happened, huh?
I didn't snitch.

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:15.233
Come on, man. You scared me.

00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:17.402
Look.

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:21.697
Hwang already knew everything, all right?

00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:24.367
Jang Geonyoung
from Busan District Prosecutors' Office

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.245
showed up and told him
you were tied up with Kang Daeil.

00:13:29.247 --> 00:13:30.415
Jang Geonyoung told him?

00:13:30.498 --> 00:13:32.542
Yeah.

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:33.876
How the hell does he know?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.211
Beats me, fucker.

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:39.841
Watch yourself, man.

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:44.220
Keep this up,
and you really might end up dead.

00:13:50.017 --> 00:13:51.477
Let me meet Cheon Seokjung.

00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:57.358
What?

00:13:58.151 --> 00:13:59.360
You thought I didn't know?

00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:04.740
You're the little rat he planted
to keep tabs on Hwang, aren't you?

00:14:09.787 --> 00:14:11.038
How long have you known?

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:13.249
Does it matter how long I've known?

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.043
Does Hwang know too?

00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:17.128
No.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.258
Why didn't you tell him? You should have.

00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:25.303
You could've gone straight to him
and said you found Cheon's mole.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.639
What for? There's no need.

00:14:29.557 --> 00:14:31.684
Hey… Oh…

00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:35.021
I thought you were just a reckless bastard
with a fucking death wish.

00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:39.859
Turns out you're a snake.

00:14:45.907 --> 00:14:47.033
Cheon Seokjung.

00:14:48.284 --> 00:14:49.410
I have to see him.

00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:52.997
I'll pay you back plenty.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.419
Baek Kitae wants to see me?

00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:00.630
What for?

00:15:00.713 --> 00:15:02.548
He has something to tell you.

00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:05.176
How much has Hwang skimmed off?

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.136
About a billion, sir.

00:15:09.263 --> 00:15:10.306
I see.

00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:13.851
I'll think about it and let you know.

00:15:13.935 --> 00:15:14.977
Yes, sir.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.450
Na Hoona or Nam Jin?
One, two, three!

00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:30.534
- Na Hoona!
- Nam Jin!

00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:31.619
Oh!

00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:33.120
Guess you really are from Gyeongsang-do.

00:15:33.204 --> 00:15:34.997
What? No. Gyeongsang-do or Jeolla-do,

00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:37.041
when it comes to singing,
Hoona's the best.

00:15:37.124 --> 00:15:38.668
Well, I like Jin better.

00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:40.586
You silly…

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.671
Well, that's good.

00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:44.924
You can have Jin. Hoona's mine.

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:49.595
Hey, you think we can just claim them?
Did Hoona ever say he's yours?

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:50.721
Or not. Whatever.

00:15:52.765 --> 00:15:53.891
By the way, Soyeong.

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:56.727
Did you really quit your job at the bank?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.230
But why? That's a great job.

00:16:00.398 --> 00:16:01.482
Well, you know.

00:16:01.565 --> 00:16:03.609
I'm sick of handling other people's money.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.945
So, have you found something new?

00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:09.073
No, I'm taking a break.

00:16:09.865 --> 00:16:11.784
Your brother didn't say anything?

00:16:12.618 --> 00:16:15.454
I mean, others would kill for that job.

00:16:15.538 --> 00:16:18.249
Mmm. My brother would never…

00:16:18.332 --> 00:16:20.459
Oh, right! Sunyeong.

00:16:21.252 --> 00:16:23.462
I have to go. I've got plans.

00:16:23.546 --> 00:16:24.630
What plans?

00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:27.174
I'm going to see a movie.
The one with Shin Seongil!

00:16:27.258 --> 00:16:29.969
Hey, I love Shin Seongil too!

00:16:30.052 --> 00:16:33.639
- Can I come? Yeah?
- What? Ah…

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.767
- Uh…
- What is it?

00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:39.103
Wait, is this a date?

00:16:40.313 --> 00:16:42.064
Gosh, you catch on fast!

00:16:42.148 --> 00:16:44.191
I'll call you later, okay?

00:16:44.275 --> 00:16:46.110
Who's the guy? Hey!

00:16:46.652 --> 00:16:47.737
Call me!

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:56.370
BOK'S KNITTING SHOP

00:17:30.946 --> 00:17:32.698
Soyeong,
I'm going to use the restroom.

00:17:32.782 --> 00:17:33.783
Okay.

00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:52.843
Hey, Daeil.

00:17:58.099 --> 00:17:59.350
It's been a while, huh?

00:18:02.978 --> 00:18:04.814
Look at you out on a date.

00:18:07.024 --> 00:18:09.944
If Baek Kitae finds out
his little sister's seeing a gangster,

00:18:10.903 --> 00:18:13.572
you think he's going to let that slide?

00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:17.243
What do you want now?

00:18:18.494 --> 00:18:21.205
I did everything
you asked last time, didn't I?

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:22.540
That was then.

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:24.625
There's a new star of the show.

00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:30.047
I know the score.

00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:31.882
You're moving meth with Baek Kitae, right?

00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:37.012
You should make it
to your sister's wedding next month.

00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:40.141
And watch her marry
into that teacher's family.

00:18:41.392 --> 00:18:43.060
I heard you even bought her a house.

00:18:43.811 --> 00:18:45.563
Looks like you made a lot of money

00:18:46.147 --> 00:18:47.690
skimming Jo Manjae's meth.

00:18:47.773 --> 00:18:48.774
Huh, Daeil?

00:18:56.699 --> 00:18:59.452
Call this number
when the first batch is out.

00:19:07.334 --> 00:19:08.335
Mr. Jang.

00:19:09.003 --> 00:19:10.212
What?

00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:13.340
Let me ask you something.

00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:16.218
You think you can take on
the KCIA and win?

00:19:16.719 --> 00:19:19.430
Want to know what I think? You'll lose.

00:19:19.513 --> 00:19:20.973
The KCIA…

00:19:21.766 --> 00:19:23.684
They're number one in this country!

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.804
You goddamn thug.

00:20:01.263 --> 00:20:02.306
Don't screw this up.

00:20:03.307 --> 00:20:04.934
Call me when the first batch is out.

00:20:24.286 --> 00:20:26.497
Jang Geonyoung,
Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

00:20:26.997 --> 00:20:28.082
This is Baek Kitae.

00:20:32.378 --> 00:20:35.214
It's been a while. So, what made you call?

00:20:35.297 --> 00:20:36.423
Have you had dinner yet?

00:20:37.132 --> 00:20:38.509
Not yet.

00:20:38.592 --> 00:20:40.427
Good. Would you care to join me?

00:20:41.804 --> 00:20:44.098
You mentioned pork and rice soup before.

00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:46.642
There's a local spot
called the Miryang House.

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.603
The broth there is nice and rich.

00:20:49.687 --> 00:20:51.397
Actually,
why don't you come here?

00:20:51.897 --> 00:20:54.692
There's a good place
right across from my office.

00:20:55.276 --> 00:20:57.820
We can order in
and have a nice, quiet dinner here.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.824
Everyone's gone for the day,
so no need to worry.

00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:06.245
All right.
I'll be there by 8:00 p.m.

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:53.834
Here.

00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:08.015
This is nice.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.188
So, why did you want to see me?

00:22:14.688 --> 00:22:16.690
Well, we said
we'd grab a meal sometime.

00:22:16.774 --> 00:22:19.610
I thought I'd make good on it
and also pay my respects properly.

00:22:19.693 --> 00:22:21.612
Respects? Come on. By the way…

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:26.033
You've got a certain vibe. You know that?

00:22:26.617 --> 00:22:28.619
What do you mean?

00:22:28.702 --> 00:22:31.413
Like right now. You're polite.

00:22:31.497 --> 00:22:32.498
Too polite.

00:22:33.123 --> 00:22:34.500
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.460
Compliment? As if.

00:22:36.543 --> 00:22:40.089
I'm saying you've got that
KCIA feel, you know?

00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:42.383
Gentleman up front,

00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:44.593
but savage in the back.

00:22:45.678 --> 00:22:47.221
Two-faced, like Janus.

00:22:47.304 --> 00:22:51.183
It looks like I've upset you
over Jo Manjae, Mr. Jang.

00:22:51.266 --> 00:22:53.102
I'm glad you know!

00:22:55.187 --> 00:22:56.981
I hope you don't hold onto it.

00:22:57.648 --> 00:22:59.316
Let's clear the air today.

00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:01.235
Fine.

00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:02.736
So,

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:04.780
did you guys catch Jo Manjae?

00:23:05.781 --> 00:23:07.282
He's gone missing.

00:23:09.868 --> 00:23:10.869
Missing?

00:23:12.246 --> 00:23:13.497
He disappeared.

00:23:14.331 --> 00:23:17.084
Well, someone claims they saw him
in the Philippines, but…

00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:20.212
He's dead.

00:23:21.714 --> 00:23:22.756
Who, Jo Manjae?

00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:25.884
Yes. You know,

00:23:25.968 --> 00:23:29.304
there was a time this whole city
was flooded with Jo's meth.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.516
It even stirred things up
across the water in Japan.

00:23:33.017 --> 00:23:36.228
But the meth's all dried up now.

00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:38.897
He suddenly disappeared, you say?

00:23:39.523 --> 00:23:41.608
Jo Manjae, the hotshot?

00:23:43.485 --> 00:23:44.486
Why?

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.655
He must've been killed.

00:23:48.073 --> 00:23:49.908
Who killed him?

00:24:05.424 --> 00:24:07.092
We'll talk about it next time.

00:24:07.593 --> 00:24:11.472
So, why'd you join the KCIA, Mr. Baek?

00:24:11.555 --> 00:24:12.681
To serve the country.

00:24:14.475 --> 00:24:16.560
Serve the country? Oh…

00:24:19.855 --> 00:24:21.732
Hey, you want to hear a funny story?

00:24:22.232 --> 00:24:24.193
What's the story?

00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:29.323
I once busted a meth dealer back in Seoul.
Mmm?

00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:31.200
And this idiot said his dream was

00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:34.161
to export meth to Japan,

00:24:34.244 --> 00:24:37.664
earn some foreign currency,
and flood all of Japan with Korean meth.

00:24:38.457 --> 00:24:40.584
He said,
"If that's not patriotism, what is?"

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.840
You see, patriotism comes in many forms.

00:24:48.592 --> 00:24:49.593
That's funny.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.139
Let me tell you another funny story.

00:24:55.057 --> 00:24:56.058
Mr. Baek.

00:24:58.143 --> 00:24:59.478
I don't care

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.271
if it's the KCIA

00:25:02.356 --> 00:25:03.774
or whoever pulls their strings.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.235
If you want to take me on,

00:25:06.944 --> 00:25:08.529
you'd better be ready.

00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:13.075
I don't break easily.

00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:20.415
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:25:21.333 --> 00:25:22.334
Mr. Jang.

00:25:24.378 --> 00:25:26.088
Man, the timing couldn't be worse.

00:25:27.714 --> 00:25:29.800
You know Jang Hyeeun, right?

00:25:29.883 --> 00:25:32.344
She works at a dye factory
in Gimpo, Gyeonggi-do.

00:25:33.428 --> 00:25:36.348
Apparently, she joined a guitar club,

00:25:36.849 --> 00:25:40.727
but we got intel the guitar instructor
has been taking funds from the North.

00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:46.066
You'd better tell your sister
to get out of there quickly.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.957
Should I be thanking you?

00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:03.542
There's no need.

00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:06.920
You and I both work for the government.

00:26:07.004 --> 00:26:09.214
We should help one another, shouldn't we?

00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:15.554
Your brother graduated top
of his Military Academy class?

00:26:17.097 --> 00:26:18.932
But I heard back in high school,

00:26:19.433 --> 00:26:22.978
Baek Kihyun got mixed up
in a pretty big incident.

00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:27.232
Why bring up my family out of nowhere?

00:26:27.733 --> 00:26:28.734
No, it's just,

00:26:29.818 --> 00:26:34.364
since you were kind enough
to take an interest in mine,

00:26:35.782 --> 00:26:39.244
I thought I'd return the favor with yours.

00:26:39.828 --> 00:26:41.079
You really want to know?

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:45.375
Not if it puts you on the spot.

00:26:49.504 --> 00:26:51.173
Guess it does. Hmm.

00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:55.177
Let me throw another one at you then.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.597
That light up there.

00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:05.145
And over here!

00:27:08.482 --> 00:27:09.483
And this.

00:27:11.777 --> 00:27:12.778
Well?

00:27:14.988 --> 00:27:17.616
Is this serving the country too? Hmm?

00:27:18.242 --> 00:27:21.411
Is the KCIA wiretapping a prosecutor
your idea of serving the country?

00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:30.921
Mr. Jang Geonyoung.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.174
This is getting nowhere.

00:27:38.637 --> 00:27:40.263
Thanks for dinner.

00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:45.018
Mr. Baek Kitae!

00:27:45.102 --> 00:27:46.561
You'll see me again! Count on it!

00:27:54.778 --> 00:27:55.862
"Serving the country"?

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:06.206
♪ Until that day when the waters
Of the East Sea run dry ♪

00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:11.378
♪ And Mount Baekdu is worn away ♪

00:28:19.386 --> 00:28:22.347
Pull the wiretap team out
and get the Jang Hyeeun file ready.

00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:24.307
Yes, sir.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:30.105
Did you say Jang Geonyoung's father is
in a mental hospital?

00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:33.066
Yes.
A municipal psychiatric hospital in Daegu.

00:28:35.527 --> 00:28:37.279
That family has its share of troubles.

00:29:43.512 --> 00:29:45.347
How many kilos?

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.515
Twenty kilos.

00:29:48.058 --> 00:29:49.392
Twenty kilos?

00:29:50.352 --> 00:29:52.771
-Is it going to Japan?
-Osaka.

00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:55.357
-Who in Osaka?
-Ikeda Yuji.

00:29:55.941 --> 00:29:57.109
Ikeda Yuji?

00:29:57.192 --> 00:30:00.028
Are you talking about the Ikeda clan
in Osaka? The yakuza?

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:02.614
Baek's delivering it himself?

00:30:03.198 --> 00:30:04.199
Yes.

00:30:06.868 --> 00:30:07.869
When?

00:30:10.288 --> 00:30:11.373
The 13th.

00:30:11.998 --> 00:30:14.084
5:00 a.m., Yeongdo.

00:30:15.502 --> 00:30:16.628
The 13th.

00:30:18.463 --> 00:30:21.007
5:00 a.m., Yeongdo.

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:35.272
The only ship going
from Yeongdo, Busan to Osaka

00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:36.815
on the 13th is the Mangeum.

00:30:36.898 --> 00:30:38.400
The Mangeum, huh?

00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:41.736
But word is, it's actually a KCIA ship.

00:30:44.197 --> 00:30:47.450
Those bastards
are really going all in, huh?

00:30:48.451 --> 00:30:49.452
Good.

00:30:50.745 --> 00:30:52.414
When will it arrive in Osaka?

00:30:52.497 --> 00:30:53.915
The next afternoon.

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:56.209
Ms. Oh, you said you speak Japanese?

00:30:56.793 --> 00:30:59.004
Yes, I learned it in school.

00:30:59.087 --> 00:31:01.339
Book the plane tickets
and hotel rooms right away.

00:31:01.423 --> 00:31:02.549
Yes, sir. I will.

00:31:02.632 --> 00:31:05.427
Mr. Kim, we don't have much time,
but gather everything you can

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.013
on the Ikeda clan,
the one Baek Kitae's dealing with.

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:09.097
Yes, sir. Got it.

00:31:09.181 --> 00:31:11.850
All right! We're flying to Osaka.

00:31:11.933 --> 00:31:14.978
We'll get there first and tail Baek Kitae.

00:31:15.562 --> 00:31:16.813
And sir, here.

00:31:17.314 --> 00:31:19.024
That thing you asked about before.

00:31:19.524 --> 00:31:20.901
There's nothing special.

00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:24.321
He's on leave from SNU's art department,
no history in the student movement.

00:31:24.404 --> 00:31:25.405
Clean record.

00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:27.199
KIM MINSU
29

00:31:27.282 --> 00:31:29.784
You said he's
your sister's guitar instructor, right?

00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:40.712
So the meth is ready?

00:31:42.464 --> 00:31:43.465
Yes, sir.

00:31:44.257 --> 00:31:45.300
How many kilos?

00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:46.843
Twenty kilos.

00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:50.180
Oh… Here.

00:31:57.812 --> 00:31:59.189
Kitae.

00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:00.523
Yes, sir.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.276
How long have we known each other?

00:32:04.069 --> 00:32:06.905
About ten years, sir.

00:32:09.115 --> 00:32:10.116
Wow.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.868
Ten years?

00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:13.870
Time really flies.

00:32:23.338 --> 00:32:24.839
Hey, send Pyo in.

00:32:29.052 --> 00:32:30.136
Osaka, did you say?

00:32:30.845 --> 00:32:31.846
Yes.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.641
All right. You're going to be
on a tight schedule,

00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:37.477
so take care of yourself, yeah?

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.397
And while you're there,
pick up a bottle of whiskey.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.317
We'll drink ourselves under the table
when you get back.

00:32:45.151 --> 00:32:46.152
Yes, sir.

00:32:53.702 --> 00:32:55.620
- Come, have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

00:32:59.249 --> 00:33:01.334
Baek's taking the meth to Japan.

00:33:01.918 --> 00:33:03.003
You should go with him.

00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:04.087
Yes, sir.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.468
-What?
-Nothing, sir.

00:33:12.304 --> 00:33:13.346
All right. Cheers.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:15.140
Have a safe trip.

00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:25.525
You can go now.

00:33:30.196 --> 00:33:31.573
I'll see you when I get back, sir.

00:33:31.656 --> 00:33:32.657
All right.

00:33:43.209 --> 00:33:46.421
Any particular reason
you're sending me with him?

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.633
He says he's delivering 20 kilos
to Chairman Ikeda.

00:33:50.717 --> 00:33:52.385
- Right.
- Keep a close eye on him.

00:33:52.469 --> 00:33:53.470
Yes, sir.

00:34:06.191 --> 00:34:09.861
Tell Choi Yuji
I want to meet her in private.

00:34:09.944 --> 00:34:10.945
Yes, sir.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:14.074
Let's get rid of him.

00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:20.121
Baek Kitae.

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:22.916
The way he looks at me…

00:34:25.168 --> 00:34:26.795
isn't the same anymore.

00:34:30.757 --> 00:34:31.883
Take care of him

00:34:33.468 --> 00:34:34.636
on the ship back to Korea.

00:34:35.553 --> 00:34:36.554
Yes, sir.

00:34:43.645 --> 00:34:45.271
The way he looks at me…

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.817
isn't the same anymore.

00:34:52.737 --> 00:34:53.822
Take care of him…

00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:57.409
on the ship back to Korea.

00:35:20.724 --> 00:35:24.978
OSAKA, JAPAN

00:35:25.729 --> 00:35:29.107
Here is
last month's balance sheet, Father.

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:35.405
I believe you'll be pleased,

00:35:35.488 --> 00:35:39.200
but if it falls short, please guide me.

00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:41.870
I hear Kimura

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:47.500
and the other executives
have been talking.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.044
You've heard already?

00:35:50.837 --> 00:35:54.340
You know it's hard to keep
the factories running in Japan now.

00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:56.426
Korea's our only option now.

00:35:56.926 --> 00:35:58.887
The quality of the sample is solid too.

00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:03.641
It may still be too soon.

00:36:05.268 --> 00:36:07.854
Don't you trust me, Father?

00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:16.946
Yeah,
you had that same look in your eyes…

00:36:19.282 --> 00:36:20.992
the first time I saw you.

00:36:21.826 --> 00:36:22.827
Still,

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.332
you seemed too good to be serving others.

00:36:27.832 --> 00:36:29.459
And I'm always grateful to you.

00:36:30.043 --> 00:36:32.921
If so, keep your head on straight.

00:36:34.714 --> 00:36:38.635
Unless you want to go back to that life.

00:36:40.804 --> 00:36:44.057
You need to earn their trust

00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:46.726
with your own ability,

00:36:47.644 --> 00:36:49.854
not because you're my daughter.

00:36:50.605 --> 00:36:53.066
If you can't get things done
without me stepping in,

00:36:54.526 --> 00:36:58.988
there's no reason to put you out front.

00:37:01.074 --> 00:37:02.075
Yes, sir.

00:37:03.034 --> 00:37:05.662
I'll make sure
you have nothing to worry about.

00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:10.667
That'd be good.

00:37:12.126 --> 00:37:15.296
I do think of you as my own.

00:37:15.964 --> 00:37:18.842
But for the sake of the clan,

00:37:18.925 --> 00:37:20.468
sometimes

00:37:21.594 --> 00:37:25.139
one must spill their own child's blood…

00:37:31.145 --> 00:37:32.146
Are you all right?

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.940
Should I call Dr. Miura?

00:37:42.949 --> 00:37:46.035
A bath. Just draw me a bath.

00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:50.832
Yes, sir.

00:37:53.293 --> 00:37:55.044
HOTEL FUKI

00:37:57.255 --> 00:37:59.340
The budget's a little tight.

00:38:00.675 --> 00:38:04.178
But I didn't know
it was this kind of place.

00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:16.441
Excuse me…

00:38:16.524 --> 00:38:19.277
I booked two rooms.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.696
It says it's one room.

00:38:21.779 --> 00:38:23.865
- That can't be.
- What's wrong?

00:38:25.283 --> 00:38:26.284
Oh…

00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:28.703
She says only one room is booked.

00:38:28.786 --> 00:38:30.747
I clearly booked two.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:32.790
Just ask for one more room then.

00:38:32.874 --> 00:38:33.875
Okay.

00:38:34.751 --> 00:38:38.296
Well… we'd like one more room, please.

00:38:38.379 --> 00:38:40.256
I'm very sorry.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.969
With the Osaka Expo going on,
we have no vacancies.

00:38:45.762 --> 00:38:46.763
Expo?

00:38:47.513 --> 00:38:48.640
Expo?

00:38:48.723 --> 00:38:49.724
Expo.

00:38:50.934 --> 00:38:52.352
She says there's no room.

00:39:34.435 --> 00:39:35.436
Man…

00:39:42.568 --> 00:39:43.778
Oh, boy.

00:40:01.337 --> 00:40:03.006
- Hello?
- Mr. Jang?

00:40:03.089 --> 00:40:04.799
Yeah. Go ahead.

00:40:04.882 --> 00:40:07.135
Sir, Baek Kitae just left on the ship.

00:40:07.218 --> 00:40:08.219
Really?

00:40:08.302 --> 00:40:10.054
But some guy got on with him.

00:40:10.638 --> 00:40:11.764
Okay, got it.

00:40:11.848 --> 00:40:13.516
Yeah.

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.143
Wait. Listen.

00:40:15.226 --> 00:40:16.602
- Wait…
- Don't hang up yet.

00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:17.687
Let's talk a little more.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.439
I'm hearing some kind of noise.

00:40:19.522 --> 00:40:21.441
- Noise?
- Are you doing something?

00:40:21.524 --> 00:40:22.984
No, what would I be doing?

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:24.318
I hear some weird…

00:40:24.402 --> 00:40:27.238
What do you… Gosh,
that's enough. I'm hanging up now.

00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:29.240
Okay. Good night, sir.

00:40:29.323 --> 00:40:30.324
Was that Mr. Kim?

00:40:33.036 --> 00:40:34.579
Yeah.

00:40:36.748 --> 00:40:38.374
He said Baek Kitae left on the ship,

00:40:39.792 --> 00:40:40.835
but he wasn't alone.

00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:42.837
Who's with him?

00:40:45.757 --> 00:40:46.799
We don't know.

00:40:48.509 --> 00:40:51.512
THE MANGEUM

00:41:27.548 --> 00:41:28.800
Boss!

00:41:41.187 --> 00:41:42.480
Boss.

00:41:44.649 --> 00:41:45.691
Hurry it up!

00:41:51.447 --> 00:41:52.532
Boss!

00:41:53.324 --> 00:41:55.076
Boss!

00:41:55.159 --> 00:41:57.078
- Back to work!
- Yes, sir!

00:41:58.204 --> 00:42:00.248
It may look like just a fish market,

00:42:00.331 --> 00:42:05.962
but this one distribution network delivers
meth to every dinner table across Japan.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.198
Boss.

00:43:15.489 --> 00:43:17.867
I'm hungry.
Want to go grab a bite to eat?

00:43:18.367 --> 00:43:21.162
How about a drink?
We closed the deal on good terms.

00:43:22.914 --> 00:43:26.459
If you don't mind, there's somewhere
I'd like to go with Mr. Baek alone.

00:43:36.886 --> 00:43:37.970
Go.

00:43:39.555 --> 00:43:41.891
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

00:43:54.654 --> 00:43:56.906
- Boss!
- Boss!

00:44:03.663 --> 00:44:07.708
KOREATOWN, OSAKA

00:44:27.937 --> 00:44:30.022
I thought you were hungry.

00:44:30.106 --> 00:44:31.107
What are we doing here?

00:44:31.607 --> 00:44:33.025
This is where I grew up.

00:44:34.235 --> 00:44:36.821
My lifelong goal was to get out of here,

00:44:37.405 --> 00:44:39.198
but I could never forget the food.

00:44:39.282 --> 00:44:41.409
- The hibiscus flower's bloomed!
- Got you! Run!

00:44:41.492 --> 00:44:42.952
Run!

00:44:43.035 --> 00:44:45.413
DON'T BE FOOLED BY PROPAGANDA!

00:44:48.082 --> 00:44:49.542
Actually, I grew up here too.

00:44:57.717 --> 00:44:58.801
Nice broth.

00:45:02.096 --> 00:45:03.472
When did you move to Japan?

00:45:04.223 --> 00:45:06.225
When I was little,
about nine years old.

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:07.435
What about you?

00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:09.395
I was born here.

00:45:11.522 --> 00:45:13.816
We might've crossed paths here back then.

00:45:15.693 --> 00:45:19.697
Come to think of it,
I think I remember seeing you.

00:45:20.448 --> 00:45:23.034
When did you go back to Korea?

00:45:23.117 --> 00:45:25.286
When I was 19,
after my father passed away.

00:45:25.369 --> 00:45:27.496
We moved to Busan, my mother's hometown.

00:45:27.997 --> 00:45:29.832
The next year, my mother passed too.

00:45:29.915 --> 00:45:32.501
So, I was busy providing
for my younger siblings.

00:45:34.628 --> 00:45:35.713
Must've been rough.

00:45:36.964 --> 00:45:38.341
Family, right?

00:45:38.841 --> 00:45:41.510
Can't win with or without them.

00:45:44.138 --> 00:45:47.808
I thought
I'd at least stop hearing "Chosenjin".

00:45:48.684 --> 00:45:51.437
But instead,
I got called "Jap" all the time.

00:45:53.981 --> 00:45:54.982
So sick of it.

00:45:58.277 --> 00:46:00.905
The food was great. I'll see you again.

00:46:00.988 --> 00:46:02.823
Thank you.

00:46:07.244 --> 00:46:09.163
I need a partner
who can produce

00:46:09.246 --> 00:46:10.915
much larger volumes on a steady basis.

00:46:12.124 --> 00:46:14.835
Right now, you're still small-time
in this business.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.465
I can't help but doubt
how much you can actually put out.

00:46:20.883 --> 00:46:24.220
How much exactly do you want?

00:46:24.929 --> 00:46:26.305
Ten times the amount now.

00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:29.100
- That would cover all of Japan--
- That's right.

00:46:29.183 --> 00:46:33.062
I need enough supply
to swallow up all of Japan in one go.

00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:37.691
That's the only way
I'll have the power to crush

00:46:39.068 --> 00:46:40.903
that greedy old man once and for all.

00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:45.408
I shut down our factory
on the outskirts of Osaka not long ago.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.536
It had a stock
of the finest Taiwanese precursors.

00:46:49.036 --> 00:46:51.956
With that, you'll have more than enough
to hit the quota I gave you.

00:46:52.039 --> 00:46:54.625
You're saying
you'll hand me the raw material?

00:46:55.668 --> 00:46:56.669
At what price?

00:46:56.752 --> 00:46:58.796
Don't worry.
I'll consider it an investment.

00:46:59.463 --> 00:47:03.551
But make sure you secure a steady pipeline
of precursors from Taiwan soon.

00:47:04.885 --> 00:47:07.304
I can't keep covering for you every time.

00:47:07.888 --> 00:47:09.348
I never asked you to.

00:47:10.683 --> 00:47:14.353
You're right.
Maybe I just want to see you.

00:47:17.064 --> 00:47:18.357
Are you coming on to me?

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.330
Sir, the deal went through smoothly.

00:47:35.166 --> 00:47:36.709
And did you talk to Choi Yuji?

00:47:37.209 --> 00:47:38.252
Yes, sir. I did.

00:47:39.753 --> 00:47:40.880
When are you coming back?

00:47:41.505 --> 00:47:42.756
We'll be on our way now.

00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:46.218
Take good care of Baek Kitae.

00:47:46.719 --> 00:47:47.803
Yes, sir. I will.

00:47:52.683 --> 00:47:55.060
HWANG GUKPYEONG, KCIA

00:48:17.374 --> 00:48:18.459
How much is that?

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.754
Comes out to about 300 million won.

00:48:23.172 --> 00:48:24.173
I see.

00:48:26.008 --> 00:48:27.676
You can buy 100 apartments with that.

00:48:30.387 --> 00:48:31.639
Name your price.

00:48:51.575 --> 00:48:55.663
PORT OF BUSAN, KOREA

00:49:04.255 --> 00:49:06.966
Man, if Pyo Haksu is in on it too,

00:49:07.049 --> 00:49:10.219
that means the KCIA is running meth
on an organized scale.

00:49:11.428 --> 00:49:13.889
At this point,
Hwang must be in on it too, right?

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.391
I guess so.

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:21.355
- Here they come.
- They're coming out.

00:49:21.438 --> 00:49:22.439
They're coming out.

00:49:22.982 --> 00:49:25.776
- That's Pyo Haksu. He's out.
- All right, get ready.

00:49:25.859 --> 00:49:27.820
- Get ready.
- Hey, get ready.

00:49:27.903 --> 00:49:28.904
Get ready.

00:49:28.988 --> 00:49:31.365
Wait. But I don't see Baek Kitae.
Baek's not here.

00:49:32.449 --> 00:49:34.994
Oh? Baek Kitae's not here.

00:49:36.245 --> 00:49:37.496
Wait, hold position.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.914
Hold position.

00:49:38.998 --> 00:49:39.999
Hold position.

00:49:41.208 --> 00:49:43.043
Stay sharp and stand by.

00:49:44.712 --> 00:49:46.463
- Car! Incoming!
- Get down!

00:49:50.884 --> 00:49:52.636
Damn, that scared me.

00:49:53.637 --> 00:49:55.472
Isn't that Director Hwang's car?

00:49:55.556 --> 00:49:56.557
Yes, it is.

00:49:57.057 --> 00:49:59.018
- What's he doing here?
- What's going on?

00:50:00.352 --> 00:50:01.812
- The cash?
- In the bags, sir.

00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:05.482
- Nice work.
- Yes, sir.

00:50:09.612 --> 00:50:11.989
Wait,
but Baek Kitae hasn't come out yet.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.782
Where is he?

00:50:13.866 --> 00:50:15.909
- Why isn't that bastard coming out?
- Damn it.

00:50:17.911 --> 00:50:20.331
What? They're turning around.

00:50:20.414 --> 00:50:22.374
-Wait. Why are they leaving?
-They're leaving.

00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:24.543
- They're coming! Down!
- What about Baek Kitae?

00:50:24.627 --> 00:50:27.504
-Hide! They're coming! Down!
-Why are they leaving without him?

00:50:32.092 --> 00:50:33.427
They left.

00:50:34.928 --> 00:50:37.640
But Baek Kitae's…
Sir, what do we do?

00:50:37.723 --> 00:50:38.724
Baek…

00:50:38.807 --> 00:50:40.517
Okay. Well…

00:50:40.601 --> 00:50:43.145
Stay hidden and watch the Mangeum closely.

00:50:43.228 --> 00:50:45.814
Make sure you see if Baek Geum…
Baek… Baek Kitae gets off!

00:50:47.775 --> 00:50:48.817
What about Baek Kitae?

00:50:49.693 --> 00:50:51.695
All taken care of, sir.

00:50:53.614 --> 00:50:54.698
Geez.

00:50:58.035 --> 00:50:59.411
And what did Choi Yuji say?

00:51:01.205 --> 00:51:04.083
We had a good talk.
She said she'd get in touch with us soon.

00:51:05.918 --> 00:51:08.462
- Take down Kang Daeil and seize the gang.
- Yes, sir.

00:51:08.545 --> 00:51:10.506
And run the factory yourself.

00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:11.674
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:51:14.259 --> 00:51:16.095
Kitae, you fool.

00:51:30.526 --> 00:51:32.236
What happened with Baek Kitae?

00:51:37.116 --> 00:51:38.701
He hasn't gotten off the ship yet.

00:51:40.119 --> 00:51:42.329
Listen, you can't lose him!
Watch closely!

00:51:43.038 --> 00:51:45.332
Sir, Baek Kitae…

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:47.668
What?

00:51:48.544 --> 00:51:49.753
Baek Kitae, what?

00:52:31.545 --> 00:52:32.546
Oh, no.

00:52:33.213 --> 00:52:34.840
Hey, hey, hey!

00:52:37.634 --> 00:52:40.888
Hey, what the heck? What's happening?

00:53:12.002 --> 00:53:15.756
Stop!

00:53:18.967 --> 00:53:20.260
What the hell is this?

00:53:22.596 --> 00:53:25.933
They had to raise hell
with a goddamn ritual today of all days?

00:53:27.893 --> 00:53:28.894
Give me.

00:53:30.062 --> 00:53:31.396
- Wait here.
- Yes, sir.

00:53:41.949 --> 00:53:43.450
-Did Baek Kitae…
-Yes?

00:53:44.868 --> 00:53:46.245
…say anything to you?

00:53:47.746 --> 00:53:50.249
He just groveled and begged for his life.

00:53:57.631 --> 00:53:58.674
I'll be here, sir.

00:54:50.892 --> 00:54:52.102
God, those bastards.

00:54:52.936 --> 00:54:54.438
Where the hell did they go?

00:54:56.773 --> 00:54:57.816
Damn it.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.146
There.

00:56:06.426 --> 00:56:07.886
Stop!

00:56:08.512 --> 00:56:10.055
Oh, dear.

00:56:10.138 --> 00:56:12.391
Stop!

00:56:32.536 --> 00:56:33.537
What the hell?

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.963
Sunja!

00:56:46.466 --> 00:56:48.135
You can't do this!

00:57:08.613 --> 00:57:10.407
Fucking bastards.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:28.592
What the hell is going on here?

00:57:29.718 --> 00:57:31.428
You!

00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:32.846
What the hell are you doing?

00:57:33.555 --> 00:57:35.015
Stop fighting!

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.184
Wait, hey! Stop them!

00:57:37.684 --> 00:57:38.727
Come on, stop them!

00:57:43.148 --> 00:57:45.358
- You goddamn vermin.
- Wait, wait…

00:57:48.612 --> 00:57:51.323
THE HALL OF ULTIMATE BLISS

00:58:29.736 --> 00:58:31.363
Hey! You!

00:58:43.333 --> 00:58:44.334
Kitae.

00:59:10.944 --> 00:59:13.154
Ms. Oh, start searching outside!

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.721
Director Hwang.

00:59:38.305 --> 00:59:39.598
What happened here?

01:00:27.103 --> 01:00:28.813
Hmm?

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.240
Ambulance.

01:00:39.324 --> 01:00:41.326
Ambulance!

01:00:58.385 --> 01:00:59.386
The phone!

01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:01.346
Where's the phone?

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:33.962
Hello? This is Jang Geonyoung
from Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

01:01:34.045 --> 01:01:36.589
I'm in Bansong, Haeundae.

01:01:36.673 --> 01:01:40.093
Someone's in critical condition here,
so send an ambulance right now.

01:01:40.176 --> 01:01:43.221
I'm here in Bansong… It's… A temple!

01:01:43.304 --> 01:01:44.556
I'm at a temple!

01:01:44.639 --> 01:01:46.766
The name of the temple?
I don't know! What?

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:50.520
There are five temples in this area?
Then send an ambulance

01:01:50.603 --> 01:01:51.855
- to all five!
- Fire!

01:01:51.938 --> 01:01:53.398
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:56.109
- Call the fire department!
- Fire!

01:01:56.192 --> 01:01:58.570
- What the hell?
- Fire!

01:01:58.653 --> 01:02:01.823
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:02:01.906 --> 01:02:03.158
Watch out!

01:02:04.617 --> 01:02:06.578
Water. Oh, water.

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:13.126
Okay. All right, move! Move out!

01:02:22.886 --> 01:02:24.304
Okay, okay.

01:02:24.387 --> 01:02:27.390
Oh, no! Stay back! It's dangerous!

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.762
