(Miao Clinic)

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:20.839
That night's hut

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.599
should be right here.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.400
Able to fight and run.

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:33.199
Such a darling

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:34.559
is now a county magistrate.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.639
He's indeed stubborn

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.879
and not very sharp.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.037
(Huang Family Shop)

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.960
You're always hunting,

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.960
and now your prey pecked your eye.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.160
You've been poisoned by that young lady.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.960
Interesting.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.160
This medicine is for taming animals.

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:50.240
It's not lethal.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.399
Did you find anything?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.930
She probably changed her name,
so it took some effort.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.559
But we figured it out.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080
She's the culprit in the Thrush Case.

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:02.479
Li Ji's younger sister,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.839
Li Yuan'er?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.279
Can you run fast?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.399
Why is it so clean here?

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.850
Take it to the magistrate's office
tomorrow for the reward.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.520
And the reward money from that gentleman

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.800
should be able to let us
live comfortably for a few years.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.350
There should still be some left.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.960
Don't chase.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.890
Stop investigating.

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.690
Leave this place.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.679
(I will die at the hands)

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.119
(of someone connected to Shi.)

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.519
Quick, put out the fire!

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.239
The case files are inside. Hurry.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:34.640
(Document Building)

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.090
Over there.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.279
- Bring water.
- Hurry!

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.359
- Quick.
- More water!

Once I settle accounts with your master,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.600
I'll come back for you.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.079
(I was unconscious yesterday)

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.320
(and didn't apply acupuncture.)

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.679
(Has it come to this?)

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.320
(What a killer.)

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.679
(Tea)
Let me see this.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:13.640
Good eye.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:19.399
A bowl of tea, please.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.399
Here.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:27.320
Wet your throat first.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.959
Miss, what's

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:38.119
the rush?

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.679
Thank you.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.679
I have an important matter to handle,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.839
but there are obstacles.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.210
Friends and foes are unclear.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.959
I'm close to failing.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.760
There's nothing in this world
that can't be done.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.200
Only...

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.559
Only what?

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.920
Only things that can't be finished.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:10.279
Thank you.

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.359
How about this one?

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:15.440
Take a look.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.990
Here, I'll put it on you.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.160
- Is it pretty?
- Yes.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.079
This one's nice too.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.279
Take another look at this one.

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:29.480
(You're obsessed with blood revenge,)

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:33.960
(so you can't grow up
like an ordinary girl.)

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.239
(Is it worth it?)

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:41.200
Why don't we
take these two home for Mother?

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.119
Alright.

00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:44.320
We'll take these two.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.239
Sure.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.719
Master Jiang.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.520
You didn't leave.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.280
Lu said
you already left Huachang County.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.880
What you said yesterday is right.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.440
Lu Yanchong and I

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.880
aren't the same kind of people.

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:02.280
I'm an orphan.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.140
I received a great favor from Li Ji,
the mastermind behind the Thrash Case.

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:07.520
That's why I want to uncover the truth.

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:08.960
Between the two of you,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.479
I trust you more.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:13.640
By the way,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.799
what exactly happened last night?

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:17.239
When I chased halfway,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.590
that person suddenly threw
the gold ingot back to me

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.039
and disappeared.

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:25.799
It has been recast.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.919
We can't tell much.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.960
For now,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.280
we can only check

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.200
the household registry
of that shop back then.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.919
Who was the lease registered under?

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.200
What is it, Master Jiang?

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.719
Document Building caught fire yesterday.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.990
All the household records
were completely destroyed.

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:43.090
The original case files
of the Thrush Case

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.280
were also lost in the flames.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.919
I'm afraid all the leads are gone.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.039
Where did Lu Yanchong go?

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.400
He only appeared once at dawn,

00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:52.760
said a few words to me,

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:53.960
and then left.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.799
No.

00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:11.612
(Mount Changyun)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.990
Why do you say the lead isn't lost
if we follow him?

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:39.479
At first, Lu Yanchong

00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:41.400
didn't refuse to act with us.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.080
But once we checked the shop,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.280
he immediately turned hostile.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.239
He didn't even enter the house with us

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:47.400
and see the box of gold,

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.990
but he immediately sent someone
to steal the ingots and distract you.

00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:51.119
What does that mean?

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.880
He had seen Huachang County's
household registry records,

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.559
knew who owned the Huang Family Shop,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.440
and guessed the identity
of the person hiding the gold ingots.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.119
(Mount Changyun)
So the lead is at Mount Changyun.

00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:05.090
There are two leaders
of the Mount Changyun bandits.

00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:06.760
I heard they're brothers.

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:09.400
The two people we spoke with
at Huang Family Shop

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.239
must be connected
to the Mount Changyun bandits.

00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:14.919
Everyone.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.590
The medicine has arrived.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.479
Looks like he's disguised
as a pharmacy staff.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.440
Could someone on this mountain be sick?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.559
The chance
to enter the mountain is fleeting.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.840
Meet me outside.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.119
I'll head over first.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.000
I want to enter the mountain stronghold.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.640
Daqiang.

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:41.200
It's not safe on Mount Changyun lately.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.919
How dare you go alone?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640
Who's this?

00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:48.080
My wife.

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:53.479
Mr. Feng sent me to deliver medicine.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.830
Why aren't you filling prescriptions
behind the counter?

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.990
Why come here in broad daylight?

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:56.599
I...

00:11:57.119 --> 00:11:58.479
Also from the pharmacy?

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:00.119
Our second-in-command

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.479
happens to need treatment.

00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:04.840
Here.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960
