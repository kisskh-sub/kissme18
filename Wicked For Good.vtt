(softly):
Goodbye, Nessa.

01:22:32.876 --> 01:22:36.082
-ELPHABA: What a touching
display of grief.
-Oh, shiz.

01:22:36.914 --> 01:22:38.109
I scare you?

01:22:38.878 --> 01:22:41.346
I seem to have
that effect on people.

01:22:42.015 --> 01:22:45.391
I would appreciate a moment
to say goodbye to my sister.

01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:46.752
Alone.

01:22:47.594 --> 01:22:49.095
Of course.

01:23:05.777 --> 01:23:08.213
Oh, Nessa.

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:11.347
Forgive me.

01:23:11.483 --> 01:23:13.444
Oh, Elphaba,
don't blame yourself, please.

01:23:13.579 --> 01:23:15.550
It's dreadful, it is.

01:23:15.685 --> 01:23:20.154
I mean...
to have a house fall on you...

01:23:20.289 --> 01:23:23.627
But accidents will happen.

01:23:23.762 --> 01:23:25.329
And...

01:23:29.298 --> 01:23:31.170
You call that an accident?

01:23:32.636 --> 01:23:35.508
You think cyclones just appear
out of the blue?

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:37.042
I don't know.

01:23:37.177 --> 01:23:38.473
I never really thought
about it...

01:23:38.608 --> 01:23:40.471
And how dare you send
that mulish farm girl

01:23:40.606 --> 01:23:41.707
off to see the Wizard,

01:23:41.842 --> 01:23:43.114
as if he could do
anything to help?

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:44.950
She's lost.
She's far from home.

01:23:45.085 --> 01:23:46.719
She took a dead woman's shoes.

01:23:46.854 --> 01:23:48.386
I had to do something.

01:23:48.521 --> 01:23:50.180
I'm a public figure now.
People expect me to...

01:23:50.315 --> 01:23:51.216
Lie?

01:23:51.351 --> 01:23:53.853
Be encouraging.

01:23:53.988 --> 01:23:56.224
Those shoes are all
I have left of my sister.

01:23:56.359 --> 01:23:58.560
They weren't yours to give.

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:04.303
Yes, well, it seems
a lot of us are taking things

01:24:04.438 --> 01:24:07.741
that don't belong to us now,
aren't we?

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:10.174
No, you just wait a clock-tick.

01:24:10.309 --> 01:24:12.112
It might be hard for you
to comprehend

01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:15.906
that someone like him
could choose someone like me,

01:24:16.041 --> 01:24:19.284
but it's happened,
and it's real.

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.281
And you can wave that
ridiculous wand all you want.

01:24:22.417 --> 01:24:23.849
You can't change it.

01:24:25.025 --> 01:24:26.418
He never belonged to you.

01:24:26.553 --> 01:24:29.254
He doesn't love you.

01:24:29.389 --> 01:24:31.057
He never did.

01:24:31.193 --> 01:24:32.363
