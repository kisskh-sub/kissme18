I think I see that guy who's chasing

I was trying a trick and wiped out.

We'll see if you're okay.

Are they equipped for a CT scan?

to the county hospital for that.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.020
I came across a skier

with a head injury.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.240
Possible intracranial bleed.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.480
I'm riding along to the hospital.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.520
Buddy,

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.480
what's your name?

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.040
It's Lin.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.720
I've only been transferred here
for a month.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.620
It's Chinese New Year,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.020
and I'm the only one on call
for the ambulance.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.620
Never thought I'd run into
something this serious.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.360
It's a good thing

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.100
we have a pro like you here.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.620
The ski patrol said

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.900
you're a neurosurgeon?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:42.660
I am.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.240
So, where do you practice?

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.600
Shanghai.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.300
I was at Songshan before.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.100
No kidding! That's impressive.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.520
This is great news.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.160
Our hospital only just opened
its neurosurgery department

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.080
last year.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.920
Having you here
really puts my mind at ease.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.280
I've been away from the hospital

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:00.940
for nearly two years now.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.160
I'm not sure how much help I'll be.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.260
No way.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.280
Why is that?

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.660
Neurosurgery

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.440
is the crown jewel

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.500
of the surgical world.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.660
You're a real big shot.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.620

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:51.660
Careful.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.000
Move it this way.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.300

in a skiing accident at 1:30 PM.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.460
He presented
with mild retrograde amnesia

Sorry. Force of habit.

He's a neurosurgeon.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.400

We'll know more

once the CT scan results

Yes, we can start the moment he arrives.

Okay.

I'm his colleague.

Excuse me,

are you a neurosurgeon

from Songshan Hospital?

That's right.

No, just stepping out for some air.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.020
I'm staying

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.920
until the patient's CT results are in.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:13:59.980
That's great.

Mr. Lei.

Alright.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.660
Hello, Dr. Lin.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:11.460
My name is Lei Wei.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.460
I'm a straight shooter,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.320
so I'll get to the point.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.420
Dr. Liu from the ski resort said

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.620
you were a neurosurgeon

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.600
at Songshan Hospital.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.440
Two years ago,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.400
I did a fellowship

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.400
at Songshan for over a year.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.540
How come I never ran into you?

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.700
When exactly were you there?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.600
May before last.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:28.940
I'd already resigned

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.560
due to a hand injury that April.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.820
A hand injury?

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.860
Now that you mention it,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.040
that rings a bell.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.300
Please, Dr. Lin, have a seat.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.160
Mr. Liao used to talk

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.300
about a surgeon

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.760
in neurosurgery

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.100
who was incredibly gifted

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.080
and had performed

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.820
dozens of solo surgeries
at such a young age.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.120
He was poised to become a giant
in the field,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.020
only to have his hands ruined

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.860
in a car accident.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.220
Was that you?

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.780
Mr. Liao Pingfeng?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.320
I believe he was talking about me.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.720
What a crying shame.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.900
You mean that Mr. Lin
we met back at Shengyuan?

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.300
What made you bring him up
all of a sudden?

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.360
He was shipped off

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.940
to Suzhou Shuangyuan Photovoltaics.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.900
The one you did that research on.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.580
I'm guessing he got pushed out
at Shengyuan.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.600
Word is, he used to be

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.400
a very promising neurosurgeon.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.260
What a waste.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.460
Being a doctor is such a sweet gig.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.280
It's thanks to you

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.380
that we got the patient here in time.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.320
Once the CT results

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.140
are in,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.340
if he's stable enough,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.760
we plan to transfer him

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:36.980
to the municipal hospital.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.000
They have

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.380
more expertise over there.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.460
After all, we're just

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.220
a county hospital.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.920
We're near the ski resort,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.420
so our orthopedics department
is actually quite strong.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.620
Our neurosurgery department

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.140
is only equipped

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.280
for emergencies.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.200
That's the right call.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.540
Whatever's best for the patient.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.640
A few years back,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.100
we had

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:57.980
an accident here.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.060
A car wreck.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:15:59.980
A severe head trauma.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.580
When they reached
the municipal hospital,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.320
it was too late.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.600
I thought to myself,

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.020
if only we had neurosurgery here,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.900
even for basic emergency procedures,

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:07.960
maybe that patient

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.780
would have survived.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.040
That's the reason

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.780
I went to Songshan for a fellowship

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.020
for over a year.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.140
I'm getting on in years.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.300
Dr. Lin,

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.260
do you think I'm overreaching?

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.200
Of course not.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.260
Medicine is a field

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.120
that requires

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.480
constant mastery.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.480
Hello?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.680
Mr. Lei,

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.280
Medical Affairs has contacted
the municipal hospital.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.460
They said there was

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:34.900
a massive pile-up downtown

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.240
this afternoon.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.320
Their ORs

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.360
are already running at full capacity.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.840
Oh no.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.100
It's not that we can't do
the surgery here.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.620
I...

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.340
I'm just worried our lack of experience

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.280
might compromise
the patient's prognosis.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.540
Mr. Lei,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.180
the CT results

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:50.680
are in.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.060
Dr. Lin, please take a look as well.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.920
It doesn't matter whether they can

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.700
take him anymore.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.620
The hemorrhage is over 70cc.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.520
There's no time for a transfer.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.440
Surgery is mandatory.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.180
Yes.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.119
We're backed into a corner.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.720
Without immediate surgery,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.500
even if he pulls through,

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:08.680
the long-term outlook is grim.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.040
Is the family here?

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.300
I'm his colleague.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.319
I can't reach his family

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.260
at the moment.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.200
Then have Medical Affairs sign off

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.099
on emergency treatment.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.819
Everyone, get ready, now.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.720
A hematoma evacuation
is a routine procedure.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
Mr. Lei, don't be too worried.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:27.579
I know.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.860
During my fellowship at Songshan,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.920
I performed a few myself,

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.800
and they went well.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.920
But that environment

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.180
makes you feel secure.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.260
Performing it on my own turf

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.740
just makes me extra on edge.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.700
Mr. Lei,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.120
the Director said he couldn't reach you.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.700
He'll be joining you

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.400
for the surgery shortly.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:44.460
Alright.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.320
Dr. Lin,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.660
I have a huge favor to ask.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:49.960
Go ahead.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.400
I'd like you to stay and provide backup.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.420
I will do everything I can

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.360
to save him.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.120
But if anything unexpected

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.280
happens during the procedure,

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.560
I'd like to rely on your expertise

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.360
for guidance.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.340
This might involve

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.760
some personal risk for you.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:07.840
Mr. Lei,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.020
I understand.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.660
I wouldn't call it "guidance,"

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.900
but with a life on the line,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.020
it is my duty,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:13.880
and I won't back down.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.360
Here are my qualification certificate

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:15.960
and my medical license.

Lesion involves
the parasellar cavernous sinus,

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.500
Meckel's cave,
and the petroclival region,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.580
extending inferiorly
into the posterior fossa,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.460
reaching the level

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.920
of the jugular foramen.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.320
We'll proceed with a combined supra-
and infratentorial approach.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.800
The tumor shows severe adhesion

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.080
to normal brain tissue
and cranial nerves.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.060

Sharp dissection required throughout.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.040
We need to define the extent
of the tentorial resection

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.120
and any nerve displacement.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.480
Midline shift

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.360
is 16 millimeters.

After the evacuation,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.580
we can replace the bone flap.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.000
I don't recommend a craniectomy.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.520
It's better for the patient's

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.240
post-op quality of life.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.140

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.160
That sounds terrifying.

Since we got him into surgery in time,
he should pull through.

and went out to grab some food.

they'll get in touch with them

I'm just too good.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.480
It died from the cold.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.920
I'll stay a bit longer.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.000
I'll head back as soon as it gets dark.

Hello, I'll take these.

your phone a bit longer?

Can't play favorites.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.680
I thought

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.420
you'd stay on the slopes
until the very last second.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.620
Can't believe you came down early.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.660
I came down for a bathroom break.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.240
Don't say it so loud,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.000
okay?

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240
When did you get down?

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.820
My battery was low,

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.620
and the cold on the mountain
just killed it.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.880
I lost track of time,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.880
so I headed down around 4 PM.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.040
I picked up some souvenirs for friends.

the subscriber you dialed

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.480
is not available at the moment.

Why isn't he picking up his phone?

He's probably still out on the runs

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.480
and didn't hear it.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.260

Even the pros get
into trouble sometimes.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.440
Besides, he is a total accident magnet.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.500
And he's still not picking up.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.260
I can't sit here.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.900

Excuse me.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.080
Could you tell us how
to get to the infirmary?

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.480

and take a left.

Hi.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.140
We were wondering

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:40.940
if a patient by the name of Lin

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.520
was brought in today?

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.740
Doesn't ring a bell.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.200
Told you you were overthinking it.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.040
I heard someone was sent

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040
to the county hospital.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.260
He wasn't named Lin either, right?

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.420
I'm not really sure about that.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.420
I was swamped at the time

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.380
and only caught a glimpse.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.220
The patient had a suspected brain bleed,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.260
so he wasn't treated here.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.480
Yeah, they called 120
up on the mountain.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.600
An ambulance took him

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.560
straight to the county hospital.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.080
Did he leave any information?

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.400
It was critical.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.500
Our staff

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.480
accompanied him to the hospital.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.740
So we don't have any records.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.340
Are you a relative?

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.440
I can't reach my friend,

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.340
so I came to check.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.160
What did the injured person look like?

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.560
He was quite tall,

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.020
wearing a black ski suit.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400
Like I said, I only caught a glimpse

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.680
before I had to
attend to other patients.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.800
Their skis are still here, though.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.840
Wait, which hospital

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.740
was he taken to?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.120
Tianchi County People's Hospital.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.620
Maybe it wasn't Lin who got hurt.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.080
There were

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.080
so many pairs of skis over there.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:25:59.800
He might've dropped

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.720
his phone somewhere,

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.040
and that's why
we can't get ahold of him.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:03.880

I don't know why, but Xiguang

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.840
insisted on waiting out
here in the cold.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.160
Let's find somewhere

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:16.720
to eat.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.520
I'm starving.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.640
I'm craving the snow hut hot pot.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:20.920
Okay.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.880
There's a hot pot place
right across the street.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.240
Let's head over and talk there.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.300
Fine by me. As long as it's warm.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:29.880
Wait a second.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.020
I have something to ask you.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.820
It took Jiang Rui and me
about 50 minutes

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.720
to get here by cab.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.400
An ambulance would be faster.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.620
Let's say 30 minutes, tops.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.020
That means in all that time,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.080
even while you were helping the patient,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.840
you still had a moment

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.780
to leave me a message on WeChat,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.980
didn't you?

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.240
Then why couldn't you

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:53.960
send me

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.860
a quick text?

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360
Even if my phone was off,

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:56.940
I would've seen it

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.080
the moment I turned it back on.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.180
I'm sorry.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.380
I've been running around looking for you

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.340
like a complete idiot.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.520
I didn't think
you'd come looking for me.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.660
Why wouldn't you?

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.600
What's the point of an apology?

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.360
When it really mattered,

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.680
I didn't even cross your mind.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.700
And you claim to like me?

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.200
I don't think

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.120
you like me at all.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.380
You knew I'd be worried,

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.540
and yet you didn't even bother to text.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:19.860
No, wait.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.600
You didn't even think
I'd be worried about you.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.600
Lin, you're dead meat.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:40.740
It's my first time seeing Xiguang

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.440
this angry.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.280
This time, I'm telling the truth.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:21.540
Mom.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.080
You're back.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.660
What happened?

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.300
What's going on with her?

if I had been the one

you'd probably have just smacked me

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.600
and been done with it.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.340
