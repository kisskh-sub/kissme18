Missing.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.210
Missing? Gone?

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.000
Mentor,

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.610
I saw Second Uncle's car outside.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:32.790
You go ahead with your work.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.240
Okay.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.120
Is he in the car?

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.480
Mr. He!

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.000
Mr. He!

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.650
Qin Feng is here.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:55.960
Qin Feng?

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.600
Yes.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:00.720
Mr. He.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.970
Captain Qin.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.120
Long time no see.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.870
I happened to be passing by
and thought I'd drop in.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.000
Hope I'm not interrupting.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.890
I'm fine.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.510
I just write a bit

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.270
every day

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.290
to pass the time.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.230
On my way over,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.770
I passed by your place.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.030
Did it look like there was

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.480
either a fire or an explosion?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.140
I saw a crowd gathered around.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.790
No.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.260
No.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.510
Just kids set off fireworks.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.870
You really shouldn't
joke about things like that.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.550
Mr. He,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.750
fire safety

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.870
is something you absolutely
have to take seriously,

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.440
right?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.270
Especially at entertainment
venues like yours.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.630
You don't want negligence

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.960
on your end creating risks for the public.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.720
Am I right?

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.320
I've got contacts in the fire department.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.200
I could ask them
to do an inspection for you.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.750
No need.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.670
No need.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:53.480
Thank you.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:55.870
Mr. He,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.240
I haven't seen your brother around.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.470
Gang is always running all over the place.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.130
Who knows where he's drinking right now.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.810
You've met him, right?

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.200
Who is this?

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.870
Wen Bo,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080
Jiangyong's son.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.120
Jiangyong's son?

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.720
Yes.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.670
Hello.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:19.800
This is Mr. Biao.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.600
In Hanzhou,

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.030
a lot of matters require his support,

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.760
understand?

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.240
I'm He Muzhi,

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.630
just call me Muzhi.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.580
Get in touch with Gang.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:32.910
I don't contact him anymore.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.840
I have no reason to reach out to him.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.620
Why not give him a call?

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.640
We need to talk to him.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:03.670
No answer.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.480
He's probably drunk somewhere.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.680
Try again.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.950
There's still no answer.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.110
This guy…

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.880
We're looking for him and can't find him,

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.240
and now even his own brother's calls
are going unanswered.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.370
How irresponsible.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.480
Young man,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.040
step outside.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.110
Look how anxious Mr. Biao is.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.230
You're afraid no one will pick up,

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.320
yet also afraid someone else might answer.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.350
Don't worry.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.120
We'll help you find him.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.010
No need.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.030
Thanks.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.920
Please don't trouble yourself.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.960
No trouble at all.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.760
You can file a report right here,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.680
right now.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.000
I really don't need to. Thanks.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.550
Alright then.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.070
Mr. He doesn't seem

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.950
to be in a good mood today.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.560
We won't bother you anymore.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.750
Let's go.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.580
We're leaving.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.450
Aren't you going to see me out?

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.400
If you have trouble, call the police.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.800
Don't shoulder it alone.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.240
There's no need.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.080
Please don't get up, Mr. He.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.040
Call me if you need anything.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.980
Qin Feng,

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.070
you really can sniff things out.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.610
Send all

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.440
our people out.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.720
Find Gang for me.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.550
Find out who did this!

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:42.680
Yes.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.780
Go now!

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.680
Yes.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.700
What are you two doing?

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.270
Give me back my stool.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.410
Sit down.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.480
What's going on here?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.090
What's going on today?

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.240
Why did you go to Grand Paradise?

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.590
It's just the three of us today.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.550
Tell us the truth.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.240
Don't lie.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.400
What are you doing?
I was about to tell him.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.750
A classmate of mine
ran into some trouble today,

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.480
so I went to lend her some money.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.920
Classmate?

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.890
Male or female?

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.880
Female.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.370
Zhou Sisi.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.810
She was my deskmate.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.890
You know her,

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.070
the tall one.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.860
Zhou Sisi.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.000
How is she doing lately?

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.790
Not so well.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.790
What happened to her?

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.500
She...

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.100
She's married.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.760
Stop beating around the bush.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.030
Have you been in touch recently?

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.430
I haven't contacted her.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.510
She reached out to me.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.680
I'm not finished explaining.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.200
She married a guy who's a gambling addict,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.530
and he ran off
after racking up a huge debt.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.680
Then the debt collectors came to

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.480
her place and
practically wrecked the shop.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.200
That's when she borrowed money from me.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.600
So she borrowed from you?

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.090
Does your wife know?

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.840
She doesn't know yet.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:15.960
Are things okay

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.930
between you two?

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.400
We are fine.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.310
And between you and Zhou Sisi?

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.910
Of course not! Are you crazy?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.960
You should be careful yourself.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.030
I'm telling you,
if problems come up in your marriage,

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.720
no one can help you.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.600
Impossible.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.790
You better behave yourself.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.440
I'll be keeping an eye on you
for your wife's sake.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.410
When you

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.860
went to

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.420
the Grand Paradise today,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.260
did you see He Gang?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.200
I think

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.440
he was dragged out by someone.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.150
By whom?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.720
It was too chaotic; I didn't notice.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.050
Look, the Grand Paradise—

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.170
including

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.150
He Gang,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.180
He Biao,

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.880
and their whole circle—

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.750
are not good people.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.480
Their business isn't clean either.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.550
Stay away from them.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.570
Don't worry.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.550
We're family.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.660
I know the score.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.400
The Grand Paradise
never looked legit anyway.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.110
So

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.370
you need to be careful.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.810
We're watching.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.510
Really, it's nothing.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.640
Don't let things go wrong

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.480
with Zhou Sisi.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.740
Keep it under control.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.070
I'm watching you for your wife's sake—

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.590
and for the whole family.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.790
She was really off today.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.630
You guys are insane, seriously.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.070
Enough.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.200
Fine.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.520
Go to sleep.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.830
That's how all those ridiculous rumors

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.790
spread.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.400
Look at you.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.310
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.310
You're laying it on too thick;
it's not helping.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.310
Without me, could you
have gotten anything out of him?

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.380
If you make another sound,

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.590
I'll shove this hammer into your head.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.540
Got it?

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.070
Who are you?

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.640
How can someone like you

There's a lead on that small workshop.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.400
A worker said someone named Wu Si

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.270
bought fireworks there,

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.480
and the residue matches

what was found
at the Grand Paradise explosion site.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.020
Isn't Wu Si the brother of Su Hongbao?

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.250
He ran away?

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.580
He's in hiding.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.750
But Wu Si has a boss called Mr. Bao.

Wu Si's been looking after him for years.

wouldn't just abandon Mr. Bao.

He's busy every day.

He's been coming home later and later,

it sounded like
he was arguing with someone,

medicated wine for bruises at home,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.610

he was fine, though.

The doctor said it's nothing—
just superficial injuries.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.920

I've got nothing left to lose,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.400
so what's this talk about asking too much?

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.160
Listen,

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:46.720
Biao,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.400
I'll call you again.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.350
Think about it.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.950
You can choose not to answer.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.070
Find time to buy yourself an urn.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.330
You might need it soon.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.070
Who

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.410
is this guy, anyway?

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.560
He's one of Ma Jin's
most ruthless enforcers.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:09.790
Back then,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.880
he took the fall for Ma Jin

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.680
and got sentenced to many years.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.380
How the hell is he out already?

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.590
Your brother's calmer than you.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.930
He can really keep his cool.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.710
Why are you staring at me?

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.880
If he wants money,

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.680
why don't we negotiate with him?

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.030
There's no way this deal
can be negotiated.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.350
First, we get our people back.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.350
How can we negotiate this?

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.810
It's unfair to begin with!

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.030
And

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.410
if we don't settle this properly,

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.170
who's going to be calling the shots
in Hanzhou from now on?

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.910
He knows way too much about us.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.350
Exactly because he knows so much—

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.350
if the cops start watching him,

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.240
won't that make things even worse for us?

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.480
Liu Tianye, let me tell you,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.510
I don't care what schemes you had
in mind before;

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.790
you can't escape this.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.750
If what happened with Ma Jin gets out,

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.280
you and I are both finished.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.380
And every one of your brothers

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.400
in Longwan,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.110
Zhao Village—

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.520
none of them will make it out alive.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.570
Understood.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:13.500
Dig into him.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.310
Find out

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.139
when he got out,

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.730
who he's met,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.070
who he's been dealing with.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:22.360
Get me all the details.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.510
Everyone has a weakness.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.639
The battle has begun.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.449
The underworld is about connections,

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.880
but it's also about violence.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.710
When I have news,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.710
I'll let you know.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.670
Sir,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.760
I miss you. Let's meet.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.590
Tianye, what's wrong?

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.050
Tianye,

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.800
your head hurts?

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.330
What's wrong?
Let me take you to the hospital.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.340
Where's your medicine?

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.070
Where did you put it?

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:39.920
Yes, take the medicine first.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.850
Take it quickly.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.800
Look,

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.420
you rest now.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.670
We'll go find him.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:59.030
Yes.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.950
Wait a minute.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.800
Listen to me,

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.730
Su Hongbao

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.200
has to be dealt with, no doubt about it.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.880
But there can't be
any more bloodshed, alright?

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.320
Then...

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320
What should we do?

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.800
We're getting in deeper and deeper.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.030
If this continues,
it will alert the police.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.150
Su Hongbao isn't exactly an easygoing man.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.510
If things don't go his way,
he could really go through with it.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.630
Wait a minute.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:29.400
Let me think, okay?

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.660
Let me think. It hurts.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.400
Tianye, we're right outside.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.000
Call us if you need anything.

[May Wealth Come Generously]

Hongbao, come sit down.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.230
-Give me a bowl of noodles.
-Okay.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.980
Still the same good taste?

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.490
By the way, Hongbao,

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.540
recently

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.370
some people from the underworld
have been asking about you.

[Jiu's Restaurant]

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.020
They went to great lengths

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.420
to find me

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.610
and left a number,

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.130
saying you should call when you see them.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.960
This one.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.960
Do you know this person?

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.820
No. I've never seen him.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.550
Okay, you can go back to work.

Who is it?

Who are you?

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.760
I'm Su Hongbao.

Hongbao.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.880
I'm Liu Tianye from Longwan.

What do you want from me?

Is it convenient to come by
our company for a chat?

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.790
Sure, no problem.

Fine. I'll be waiting.

Why did Su Hongbao kidnap your brother?

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:33.480
He thought my business was doing too well,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.190
so he wanted a piece of it.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:37.070
Stop beating around the bush.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.310
You two are experienced men.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.070
You know business troubles

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.130
shouldn't affect family, don't you?

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:46.360
What exactly happened?

You finally made something of yourself.

in your eyes

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.640
I'll always be that security guard
from back then.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.630
You know better than anyone

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.480
what Gang means to me,

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.610
how important he is.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.110
For the sake of our past relationship,

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.040
I'm begging you,

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:30.960
please help me.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.890
I can't help you.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.800
Don't try to play on our old ties.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.920
The only thing I can do is

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.450
introduce you to the person

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.610
in charge of this case,
so you can speak to them directly.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.450
Now that you're in a position of power,

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.210
you look down on me.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.210
I thought we were good brothers back then.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.480
Back then,

I gave you my complete trust and loyalty,

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.130
and you helped me whenever you could.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.450
But now it seems that

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.840
I was nothing

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.760
more than a tool for you

to earn merit, win commendations,
and advance your career,

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:07.840

your business has grown,

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.080
and you've made many connections.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.670
If your brother
hadn't gotten into trouble,

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.600
you wouldn't have come to me at all.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280
To put it plainly,

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.230
if it weren't for the title

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.120
of deputy director,

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.510
you would probably
pretend not to recognize me

even if you ran into me on the street.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.500
Are you really that eager to
cut all ties with me?

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.510
Fine.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.450
If you don't want to talk about feelings,

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.410
then let's talk about interests.

Stop resorting to these
crooked ways, alright?

Take my advice—

If Gang really did something wrong,

will you arrest him?

If he really did something wrong,
I will definitely arrest him.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.050
Not just him,

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:06.150
even if it were you,

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.190
if you break the law,

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.020
I'll arrest you just the same.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.840

don't blame me for turning against you.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.550
I'm laying it out right now.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.310
If you don't help me with this,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.590
I'll report you immediately,
