00:45.604 --> 00:48.562
Come on, brother!

01:10.582 --> 01:13.596
- Careful!
- You were on the road, brother.

01:31.562 --> 01:34.590
- Can't you take it anymore?
- Do you want it to go faster?

01:51.566 --> 01:54.594
- That was great.
- Let me go, skxawng.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.582
- Have a good trip, brother.
- Give me four.

02:08.606 --> 02:11.578
I have to make sure I come back.

02:11.582 --> 02:15.606
Little brother, tell
me something first.

02:17.606 --> 02:20.594
How did I die?

02:25.600 --> 02:31.560
They shot you. He wanted
us to come back for Spider.

02:32.570 --> 02:35.576
We had to do it.
It wasn't your fault.

02:35.580 --> 02:40.588
Tell dad. We shouldn't
have been there.

02:40.592 --> 02:43.584
They caught us because
I was disobedient.

02:43.588 --> 02:46.580
That's you, little brother.

02:55.598 --> 02:59.564
- I love you, brother.
- Your skxawng.

03:04.594 --> 03:09.562
I killed my brother. Whatever happens,

03:09.566 --> 03:12.584
-I'll have to live with it for the rest of my life.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.564
- I wish I could.
- I wish I could.

03:56.580 --> 04:00.562
But if I have another
seizure underwater...

04:00.566 --> 04:02.582
So you're me without a mask.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.568
Let's see what happens.

04:07.572 --> 04:12.578
Be careful with the
points! What do you think?

04:35.572 --> 04:40.592
The fire of hate only
leaves the ashes of pain.

04:40.596 --> 04:43.594
My mother lamented
in the old fashioned way.

04:43.598 --> 04:48.568
She sang about her son's
life during the daily eclipse.

04:48.572 --> 04:50.606
Because the light
always returns.

04:59.592 --> 05:03.604
There is the Na'vi method and
then there is my father's method.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.578
Stay calm and busy.

05:25.570 --> 05:28.602
The people of the reef
say that the sea cleans us.

05:28.606 --> 05:31.590
- and wash away the sins.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.584
What do you have there?

06:10.598 --> 06:15.580
We are collecting firearms. The
ones that don't work. Concentrate.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.574
Don't let mom see it.

06:31.576 --> 06:35.560
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. Play!

06:42.564 --> 06:43.588
Bridge.

06:44.594 --> 06:45.606
Sweaty.

06:47.578 --> 06:49.586
What is happening?

06:49.590 --> 06:53.582
Tsireya, what are you doing?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.574
It's an assault rifle.

06:58.578 --> 07:02.584
This is the cartridge
magazine. It's empty.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.584
Press it down, let it go, - - And then you

07:05.588 --> 07:10.572
can shoot. It can kill many people from heaven.

07:10.576 --> 07:14.586
Ceramic base. They only
need cleaning and lubrication.

07:14.590 --> 07:20.560
- The Na'vi don't use that, Jake Sully.
- Metal weapons are prohibited.

07:20.564 --> 07:23.590
You already know it. Touching
them poisons the heart.

07:23.594 --> 07:26.604
Eywa takes care of us.

07:27.598 --> 07:29.574
Yes.

07:29.578 --> 07:34.586
The duel is not over. You
should be with your family.

07:34.590 --> 07:40.572
No corras por ahí coleccionando
cosas. Your wife needs you.

07:41.568 --> 07:46.588
My son rests with his ancestors
on the reef. This is our home.

07:46.592 --> 07:51.576
I have promised to defend it,
but I cannot do so with a spear.

07:51.580 --> 07:55.564
We sank the demon ship.
The light skins now fear us.

07:56.594 --> 08:00.604
We were lucky. And they
have many more ships.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.586
At least we have them here.

08:03.590 --> 08:07.606
We appreciate your help,
but we don't need shooters.

08:08.562 --> 08:11.568
We need the Last Shadow Rider.

08:11.572 --> 08:15.590
Ride the mighty toruk
as you did before.

08:17.576 --> 08:21.560
When you ride the animal,
you become one with the animal.

08:22.574 --> 08:25.582
And the more blood, the better.

08:25.586 --> 08:29.606
I don't want to be
Toruk Makto again.

08:31.560 --> 08:35.574
Jake Sully, you will
always be Toruk Makto.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.600
Come on. Rotxo.

08:44.568 --> 08:45.596
Can you hear me?

08:45.600 --> 08:48.606
Yes, loud and clear.
Speak louder, doctor.

08:49.562 --> 08:52.564
We have finally gone
around the shipwreck.

08:52.568 --> 08:56.560
- and everything within a
200 meter radius around it.

08:56.564 --> 09:00.592
We didn't find anything.
Only human remains.

09:00.596 --> 09:05.576
Keep searching.
Expands the search radius.

09:05.580 --> 09:08.604
However, I found a
new and exciting algae.

09:10.566 --> 09:11.586
Hello?

09:11.590 --> 09:13.600
Sully is still alive.

09:13.604 --> 09:16.560
Predators may have
taken the bodies.

09:16.564 --> 09:22.562
No, he survived and is
somewhere in this area.

09:22.566 --> 09:26.586
- If only I could get a boat...
- Your boat is down there.

09:26.590 --> 09:31.566
Along with my dead crew.

09:31.570 --> 09:35.582
You brought me the 42 trillion miles here.

09:35.586 --> 09:40.598
- Carry out a mission.
Kill and annihilate a man.

09:40.602 --> 09:43.574
I'm not going to give it up.

09:46.606 --> 09:51.596
Are we still connected?
Hello? Have I been silenced?

09:58.592 --> 10:05.572
The spirit of the ancestors is
in this arch. It was our strength.

10:07.602 --> 10:11.572
I can fix it for you, Lo'ak.

10:12.562 --> 10:13.594
No!

10:13.598 --> 10:16.584
It's broken.

10:16.588 --> 10:19.600
Everything I touch is destroyed.

10:23.594 --> 10:26.598
They never said it out loud.

10:26.602 --> 10:31.570
But he was lurking,
like a thanator lurking.

10:34.582 --> 10:38.584
I know you will never give up the bow.

10:38.588 --> 10:40.592
So here.

10:44.582 --> 10:46.570
Keep a good distance when he hits you.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.566
So do you agree with Ronal?

11:10.606 --> 11:15.596
I would never contradict my
husband in front of that woman.

11:17.562 --> 11:19.566
I'm a marine.

11:20.570 --> 11:23.576
I won't bring a knife to a gunfight.

11:24.574 --> 11:26.588
Or beans.

11:28.564 --> 11:33.596
What do I do then?  I can't run or fight.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.564
Well, no, Eywa takes care of us.

11:37.568 --> 11:40.574
But where was
Eywa when our son...?

11:40.578 --> 11:42.576
Jake!

11:44.562 --> 11:47.594
I am in a place where I have nothing.

11:47.598 --> 11:51.598
Neither my people nor my forest.

11:51.602 --> 11:54.600
Not even my father's bow.

11:56.598 --> 11:59.566
The only thing I have - -I

11:59.570 --> 12:04.568
think this is grandma's plan.

12:06.592 --> 12:09.570
You have your family.

12:22.582 --> 12:28.562
And you have me. And
I love you very much.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.908
Payakan, you are too cool!

13:24.934 --> 13:27.910
How wild!

13:51.908 --> 13:54.922
- It was a shame.
- I know.

13:56.908 --> 13:59.898
I thought you were dead.

14:01.904 --> 14:04.896
It's a shame Payakan
is still an outcast.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.932
He saved us all.

14:06.936 --> 14:10.928
According to tulkun
custom, he takes the blame.

14:10.932 --> 14:14.918
- for all those
who died in battle.

14:16.926 --> 14:19.916
It hurts me. You saved us.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.940
Forever, brother. Always.

14:42.900 --> 14:43.936
Sheep!

14:47.904 --> 14:50.902
Where is the
reservation? Wake up!

14:50.906 --> 14:54.904
- Where is the spare mask?
- Don't know.

14:54.908 --> 14:57.898
- Find it!
- It's not here.

14:57.902 --> 14:59.902
I can't find it Dad,

14:59.906 --> 15:03.940
I have it! I found it!

15:09.936 --> 15:12.934
- Breathe.
- Breathe.

15:12.938 --> 15:17.896
Deep and calm. So.

15:17.900 --> 15:21.902
-You will make it.
-I'm fine.

15:22.930 --> 15:27.920
-You have to be careful.-
"Caution" is my middle name.

15:27.924 --> 15:30.902
You have to be more careful.

15:30.906 --> 15:34.914
- Leave me alone.
- "Tonto" is your middle name.

15:34.918 --> 15:38.912
-You must be on guard.
-"Skxawng" is his middle name.

15:41.894 --> 15:44.920
Wind peddlers are here!

15:45.904 --> 15:49.894
- The street vendors are coming!
- Come with me.

16:37.894 --> 16:38.926
See.

16:39.922 --> 16:45.896
- It doesn't take up much space.
- As long as it doesn't cause problems.

16:45.900 --> 16:49.894
On your knees. Tuk. Kiri.

16:49.898 --> 16:51.912
Children, sit down.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.924
Mom and I have made a decision.

17:00.916 --> 17:06.914
Spider, you have to go back to High
Camp. The charlatans are taking you away.

17:06.918 --> 17:10.894
You can't live with a
mask day and night.

17:10.898 --> 17:14.926
- I just want to be here with you.
- Yes, but it's too dangerous.

17:14.930 --> 17:19.900
-You are my only family.
-It's the best for you.

17:19.904 --> 17:23.910
- But he's our best friend.
- It's very dangerous.

17:23.914 --> 17:28.908
- You're one dead battery away from dying.
- He belongs to his own.

17:28.932 --> 17:33.930
And who is it, mother?
A stranger? A pale pig?

17:33.934 --> 17:39.904
You hate them so much
that's all you see. That's Spider.

17:40.898 --> 17:43.916
Please, Jake. You know
I'm not causing any problems.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.936
- That's not right.
- Spider is part of the family.

17:46.940 --> 17:50.914
He will never be
part of our family.

17:52.932 --> 17:57.932
The caravan is the safest
way to move it. He leaves today.

17:57.936 --> 18:03.934
Spot. This is a family,
not a democracy.

18:03.938 --> 18:07.904
- I hate you!
- It's better this way.

18:07.908 --> 18:09.908
Do not touch me!

18:09.912 --> 18:11.932
Alright.

18:12.910 --> 18:14.930
- You understand?
- No.

18:14.934 --> 18:18.936
I have lost my brother. I
don't want to lose any more.

18:25.916 --> 18:28.930
The Sullys stick together.

18:28.934 --> 18:31.930
That's the family motto.

18:34.940 --> 18:38.906
- That's not fair.
- Okay, okay.

18:38.910 --> 18:42.910
How about we follow
him there together?

18:42.914 --> 18:46.932
Kiri, you wanted
to visit grandma.

18:46.936 --> 18:50.936
It will be an adventure
for the whole family.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.930
Pretty nice.

19:09.922 --> 19:10.930
Stay here.

19:13.906 --> 19:16.936
Our agreement only applied
to the pale-skinned boy.

19:16.940 --> 19:19.940
- We're not causing any problems.
- It can't be helped.

19:20.896 --> 19:23.898
Traders cannot choose sides.

19:23.902 --> 19:29.896
Having Toruk Makto on board is
a lot like choosing sides in a war.

19:29.900 --> 19:34.912
You are wrong. Toruk
Makto was never on your ship.

19:36.906 --> 19:39.922
But if he were on board, - - He and his wife

19:39.926 --> 19:45.894
would gladly fly to escort and protect the caravan.

19:46.936 --> 19:51.936
Maybe. Mangkwan's thieves
have become more aggressive.

19:53.914 --> 19:56.930
Excellent. It's a deal.

20:02.896 --> 20:03.910
Throw it away!

20:04.924 --> 20:05.924
Come!

20:09.904 --> 20:10.936
Throw it away!

20:16.902 --> 20:18.914
Look!

20:18.918 --> 20:21.916
- Tsireya!
- Lo'ak!

20:22.900 --> 20:24.900
Ready to spin!

20:25.920 --> 20:28.896
Ready to spin!

20:28.900 --> 20:29.924
Bow to starboard!

20:37.902 --> 20:41.932
- Onboard flap control!  - Full to windward!

20:52.894 --> 20:54.936
Power up the ship and accelerate!

22:00.894 --> 22:03.914
Each one suffers in their own way.

22:05.936 --> 22:08.936
I'm doing it up here alone.

22:11.930 --> 22:15.898
I feel like he is with me.

22:16.894 --> 22:17.900
Look here.

22:17.930 --> 22:20.926
I hear his voice in the wind.

22:36.904 --> 22:38.898
keep it here

22:46.934 --> 22:48.936
Dad, I've been thinking about something.

22:48.940 --> 22:53.908
I should carry a rifle and fly with you.

22:53.912 --> 22:56.926
- That's not going to happen.  - Why not?

22:56.930 --> 22:59.932
You taught me how to shoot.  I know what I'm doing.

22:59.936 --> 23:03.924
Where is your radio?  I have called you several times.

23:05.894 --> 23:06.922
Remember your radio

23:06.926 --> 23:08.910
This is rule number 1.

23:10.908 --> 23:13.906
You can't even imagine it.

23:23.934 --> 23:25.918
Next.

23:27.894 --> 23:28.924
There.

23:30.900 --> 23:31.928
What do you have?

23:31.932 --> 23:36.908
I had promised to be careful with the beer if they ever found some for us.

23:36.912 --> 23:41.910
One of our patrols saw them during a routine flight.

23:41.914 --> 23:42.936
Here is an extension.

23:47.898 --> 23:50.896
Smile, idiots.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.940
- When?  - Today 1:50 p.m.

23:53.896 --> 23:57.902
-I have the coordinates.-Let's get on the chair.

24:12.918 --> 24:16.900
Pull the rope!

24:31.930 --> 24:34.936
-Your vending
machine.-There is plenty of time.

24:46.894 --> 24:47.914
The coast is clear.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.620
Jake! Mangkwans!

25:07.636 --> 25:09.646
- To arms!
-Sound the alarm!

25:17.616 --> 25:19.616
Kiri, run!

25:20.618 --> 25:22.604
Take refuge!

25:34.606 --> 25:37.632
- Protect your sisters.
- Yes. Stay covered.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.614
Spider, here!

26:11.604 --> 26:13.618
Shit, my radio.

26:25.630 --> 26:29.604
- Stay with the girls.
- What are you going to do?

26:31.630 --> 26:33.648
You should stay here!

27:00.648 --> 27:02.630
Come!

27:03.634 --> 27:05.606
Now!

27:17.622 --> 27:19.620
Back!

28:05.640 --> 28:08.610
I am the fire!

29:11.636 --> 29:14.632
Run, run! Up, up!

29:14.636 --> 29:17.618
Come on, quick!

29:23.628 --> 29:26.642
- Spider, jump!
- Come on!

29:53.648 --> 29:56.622
Neytiri, do you hear me?

30:03.610 --> 30:04.638
Piss, piss, piss.

30:06.626 --> 30:09.632
It's Lo'ak. We have to save it.

30:11.604 --> 30:13.634
- Lo'ak, jump!
- Come on!

30:16.630 --> 30:18.638
One moment everyone!

30:30.624 --> 30:32.634
Wait, Lo'ak!

30:43.622 --> 30:45.610
Wait, Tuk!

30:55.618 --> 30:58.604
Spider, my leg.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.634
Get up.

31:03.638 --> 31:08.608
- Are you OK?
- Tuk, are you okay?

31:08.612 --> 31:10.628
Are you OK?

31:10.632 --> 31:14.648
- Can you handle it?
- My beautiful girl...

31:15.604 --> 31:19.608
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Alright.

31:29.648 --> 31:31.624
Thank you.

31:32.608 --> 31:36.638
My reservation is on board.
My spare parts vending machine.

31:36.642 --> 31:39.614
Piss. Kiri, stay here.

32:26.626 --> 32:28.610
Behind them!

32:29.638 --> 32:31.614
We have to go!

32:33.628 --> 32:36.626
- Come on!
- Kiri, they're coming!

32:42.602 --> 32:45.640
- They're coming!
- Forward!

32:47.620 --> 32:50.632
- Over here!
- Come on, Tuk!

33:14.642 --> 33:16.644
Beyond, beyond.

33:20.612 --> 33:22.612
What happened?

33:24.620 --> 33:27.636
One has already
passed. Look, tsahìk.

33:33.648 --> 33:35.616
Knife.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.624
Follow me.

33:57.610 --> 33:59.612
- Come on.
- Tap here.

34:05.636 --> 34:06.646
There!

34:12.642 --> 34:14.630
They are coming.

34:14.634 --> 34:17.624
Let's go this way!

34:19.614 --> 34:20.644
Further!

34:24.606 --> 34:26.640
- Over here!
- To the water.

34:26.644 --> 34:30.648
- Come, come, come.
- Look!

34:31.604 --> 34:33.628
Let's go swimming!

34:36.634 --> 34:41.622
- Lo'ak!
- Tuk, what does dad always say?

34:41.626 --> 34:44.626
- Sullyer stays together.
- No, the other one.

34:44.630 --> 34:49.622
- Sullyer never gives up.
- That is to say. Sullyer never gives up.

34:52.606 --> 34:53.624
Nothing.

34:54.616 --> 34:57.636
Kiri! Tuk, wait!

35:01.614 --> 35:04.602
Kiri? Kiri!

35:05.626 --> 35:07.604
Spider!

35:08.622 --> 35:10.640
Take my hand.

35:19.624 --> 35:22.602
Eagle Eye, are you there?

35:26.648 --> 35:29.638
Lo'ak, answer me.

35:37.628 --> 35:40.614
Neytiri, are you there?

35:42.610 --> 35:43.612
Neytiri.

35:43.616 --> 35:45.602
Is it there?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.624
Neytiri, are you there?

35:51.624 --> 35:53.612
Hit!

35:54.604 --> 35:56.648
Swim! Come on!

35:58.622 --> 36:02.606
- Take a stone.
- I got you, Tuk.

36:07.632 --> 36:10.634
Is everyone okay? Spider?

36:10.638 --> 36:12.642
Yes, it's going well.

36:21.620 --> 36:26.622
- Can you see them?
- No. Let's hide.

36:26.626 --> 36:28.648
-I want to go
home.-Come on, Tuk.

36:29.604 --> 36:33.616
I'm tired and hungry.
I want to go home.

36:33.620 --> 36:38.602
Dad has no idea where we
are and we don't have a radio.

36:38.606 --> 36:39.622
We have to fend for ourselves.

36:40.614 --> 36:43.628
-I need a mask.
-What do we do?

36:43.632 --> 36:48.638
- Why should I decide?
- We have to do something.

36:48.642 --> 36:51.606
So stop.

36:51.610 --> 36:55.616
Lo'ak, we have to
return to the ship.

36:55.620 --> 36:58.612
But they are between
us and the ship.

36:58.616 --> 37:02.620
This is where we were last seen
and where dad will look for us.

37:02.624 --> 37:05.636
- We will surround them.
- Good idea. Where?

37:07.640 --> 37:10.624
Here. Follow me.

37:17.616 --> 37:20.628
The game is over, Jake.

37:24.614 --> 37:26.630
Stay completely still.

37:30.626 --> 37:34.616
- Is that what you have inside?
- That's good.

37:34.620 --> 37:38.636
Still tight-lipped. Hands up.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.642
I killed you.

37:46.626 --> 37:49.616
I don't die so easily, corporal.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.622
Help…

38:10.638 --> 38:12.644
Who attacked you?

38:12.648 --> 38:16.636
Mangkwan Thieves. They call
themselves "The Ash People.

38:18.622 --> 38:19.640
" What is it?

38:19.644 --> 38:25.642
- They cut off the kuru of their enemies.
- A fate worse than death for them.

38:28.642 --> 38:31.630
- Any sign of them?
- The children are gone.

38:31.634 --> 38:36.624
It is fully charged. That means
your mask will soon run out.

38:36.628 --> 38:39.642
-if the Ash People
don't kill him first.

38:39.646 --> 38:44.630
We have to find them now
or you'll never see him again.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.640
- Can you track them?
- That's not our job.

38:49.644 --> 38:52.644
- Can you track them?
- Time is running out.

38:52.648 --> 38:54.646
Now we have it.

38:56.648 --> 39:00.606
The handcuffs stay on. To where?

39:03.632 --> 39:07.604
You will be my death. Again.

39:10.737 --> 39:12.747
Here.

39:14.765 --> 39:17.759
We should be at the river soon.

39:25.729 --> 39:27.739
- Spider!
- Bridge!

39:27.743 --> 39:30.731
-This is not good.
-What do we do?

39:30.735 --> 39:35.747
Save, monkey. Look
at me. Breathe slowly.

39:35.751 --> 39:40.769
"Lo'ak, can you carry it?"
-Yeah. Come, I'll take you.

39:59.769 --> 40:03.731
- They have gone through the water.
- Sage.

40:10.753 --> 40:13.739
No, no, no...

40:13.743 --> 40:15.749
Oh no, Spider.

40:18.733 --> 40:22.759
Grandma, save the boy
from heaven. I beg you.

40:22.763 --> 40:25.773
There is no time for
prayers. He is dying.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.749
Everything will be fine, friend.

40:31.767 --> 40:34.771
Kiri. Kiri, we have to move on.

40:42.735 --> 40:45.773
We have to move
forward. We can't stay here.

40:46.729 --> 40:49.737
We'll be there right
away. We can't stay here.

40:49.741 --> 40:51.765
Tuk, take it.

40:51.769 --> 40:53.763
Come on, Kiri.

40:59.747 --> 41:00.769
Arrest!

41:02.727 --> 41:06.745
- Come here with him.
- Kiri, stop it. Enough.

41:07.745 --> 41:09.735
Do what I tell you!

41:12.767 --> 41:15.769
Put it down.

41:28.743 --> 41:30.771
What are you doing?

41:34.757 --> 41:37.771
- What are you doing?  - I'm not sure.

41:38.727 --> 41:43.763
It just feels good.
I can't talk now.

41:55.749 --> 41:56.757
Look!

42:26.727 --> 42:28.757
Take off his mask.

42:28.761 --> 42:31.767
- That?  - He can't breathe.

42:33.767 --> 42:35.751
Come on.

43:18.745 --> 43:22.739
Kiri?  Kiri, Kiri...

43:24.727 --> 43:26.743
Look, no.

43:35.759 --> 43:39.759
Oh no...

43:40.765 --> 43:43.737
Forgive me.

44:00.757 --> 44:03.743
Forgive me.

44:17.769 --> 44:19.755
Spider!

44:40.763 --> 44:46.753
-I'm breathing.
-Yes, monkey, you are.

44:49.755 --> 44:53.749
I'm dead. I am in
the spiritual world.

44:54.767 --> 44:57.737
No, you're still here.

44:59.737 --> 45:03.737
- I can breathe the air.
- Yes.

45:03.741 --> 45:05.761
I can breathe the air!

45:05.765 --> 45:08.761
I can breathe the air!
I can breathe the air!

45:10.755 --> 45:13.769
So I don't need this shit anymore.

45:13.773 --> 45:16.773
I can breathe the air!

45:17.729 --> 45:19.727
Silence, silence.

45:23.739 --> 45:25.753
Thank you.

45:25.757 --> 45:28.757
For whatever you've done.

45:30.737 --> 45:33.727
Shit! Careful!

45:34.747 --> 45:36.755
Stay behind me!

45:40.741 --> 45:41.771
We're trapped!

45:44.733 --> 45:46.755
Behind us!

46:03.757 --> 46:05.729
Tsahik.

46:29.763 --> 46:32.769
How will he be able to
breathe without a mask?

46:32.773 --> 46:37.745
Now it doesn't matter.
We have to get in there.

46:38.747 --> 46:42.765
Isn't our air toxic?

46:42.769 --> 46:45.745
- For the people of heaven?

46:51.727 --> 46:56.755
How can you stay
alive, air breather?

46:58.751 --> 47:00.767
Because it is Eywa's will.

47:06.761 --> 47:10.741
- Eywa?
- Yes.

47:13.731 --> 47:18.769
If I cut it, do you think
Eywa will come to save it?

47:18.773 --> 47:22.727
Get them off my
back. Lo matarán.

47:22.731 --> 47:24.767
Do you believe that?

47:26.741 --> 47:28.733
No.

47:28.737 --> 47:33.749
Your goddess has no power here.

47:33.753 --> 47:36.743
Come on. Dame el cuchillo.

47:41.735 --> 47:42.769
Here we go.

47:50.751 --> 47:51.769
You.

47:54.761 --> 47:58.741
Show me how it works.

48:03.753 --> 48:08.763
- Teach me how to make thunder.
- It's empty. There is no thunder.

48:08.767 --> 48:13.749
- Make noise.
- Can't. It's empty.

48:15.733 --> 48:18.755
Listen now. There is no thunder.

48:18.759 --> 48:23.743
-Kill the youngest.
- ¡No, no, no!

48:36.741 --> 48:39.729
Put down your weapons!

48:41.771 --> 48:44.745
- Put them down!
- ¡Mangkwaner!

48:45.737 --> 48:49.739
Then stay away. Get away.

48:52.759 --> 48:55.741
Go away! Go away!

48:58.745 --> 49:02.729
- Dad!
- Children, follow me.

49:02.733 --> 49:06.749
Well, let's list it.

49:06.753 --> 49:08.747
Follow me.

49:22.761 --> 49:24.755
No! Dad!

49:30.761 --> 49:33.727
Move now.

49:42.745 --> 49:45.755
- No!
- Dad!

50:01.763 --> 50:05.767
You are strong, man of heaven.

50:10.769 --> 50:12.735
You.

50:14.759 --> 50:17.757
Teach me how to make thunder.

50:18.771 --> 50:21.735
That's how it works.

50:25.753 --> 50:28.741
Is it there?

50:29.735 --> 50:33.751
Then aim for what
you want to achieve...

50:34.755 --> 50:37.737
...and do it like this.

50:44.735 --> 50:45.739
Again.

50:51.767 --> 50:54.751
That's great, right?

51:10.739 --> 51:14.733
I don't need you anymore,
man from heaven. Tie it tight.

51:14.737 --> 51:17.751
- Get on your knees!
- Prepare for the sacrifice!

51:29.741 --> 51:31.743
Neytiri!

51:31.747 --> 51:34.765
Cut it. Hold her.

51:35.765 --> 51:40.757
Neytiri, we've got you
covered. You will make it.

51:40.761 --> 51:44.729
Max, prepare to
operate. Open the doors!

52:03.553 --> 52:06.549
Those pigs know
how to tie knots.

53:46.549 --> 53:48.529
Come on.

53:49.547 --> 53:51.527
Come on.

53:52.549 --> 53:53.565
Hurry up!

54:05.545 --> 54:07.543
It was the girl.

54:07.547 --> 54:10.527
Come on, jump!

54:10.531 --> 54:13.565
Come on. Come on.

54:27.535 --> 54:28.535
Tsahik.

54:30.533 --> 54:32.541
They are gone.

54:34.525 --> 54:36.531
We lead from the air.

54:45.531 --> 54:47.537
Tarsem.

54:48.561 --> 54:52.525
- Calm down, calm down.
- Stay still, girl.

54:52.531 --> 54:53.565
Stop her.

54:54.521 --> 54:57.521
-My children...
-Neytiri, calm down.

54:57.525 --> 55:00.565
-Calm down, daughter.
- My children!

55:01.521 --> 55:05.525
Where? Where are they?

55:21.555 --> 55:24.549
Come on, Max, are we ready?

55:24.553 --> 55:27.527
- We're ready.
- Leave the calibration.

55:28.563 --> 55:32.533
You must rest, my son.

55:32.537 --> 55:34.541
- Bye bye.
- Thank you.

55:35.547 --> 55:38.559
-I want to ride.-No, no...

55:41.525 --> 55:43.559
I can go.

55:50.539 --> 55:52.559
I got you.

55:59.545 --> 56:02.521
It's nice here.

56:11.545 --> 56:14.549
-There are no Moors on the coast.
-Yeah.

56:14.553 --> 56:19.535
Then we can resume
our settlement.

56:23.543 --> 56:25.525
I don't have arrows.

56:27.561 --> 56:31.531
We still have our knives.

56:35.527 --> 56:37.529
I'm very tired.

56:39.539 --> 56:42.563
Yes. Let's save our energy.

56:45.523 --> 56:49.521
What would happen if the
flying monkeys came again?

56:51.563 --> 56:54.531
Accept.

57:04.533 --> 57:09.547
You and your wife must have done
something right. He's a good boy.

57:11.527 --> 57:14.529
He is a beautiful boy.

57:15.527 --> 57:20.525
This doesn't mean we have
to take long walks together.

57:20.529 --> 57:24.523
Still, you need to be
delivered. Dead, if necessary.

57:26.539 --> 57:31.527
You've been here so long
and you still don't understand it.

57:31.531 --> 57:36.539
This world is much deeper
than you can imagine.

57:37.523 --> 57:40.531
You saw it tonight.

57:40.557 --> 57:44.553
With her and with him.

57:45.555 --> 57:47.563
It doesn't matter.

57:49.525 --> 57:53.555
It doesn't matter
what color it is.

57:53.559 --> 57:57.541
I still know which side I'm on.

57:58.565 --> 58:03.565
You have new eyes, colonel.
You just have to open them.

58:25.557 --> 58:31.533
It's the Ash People!
Come on, we have to go!

58:31.537 --> 58:33.547
Come on, we have to go.

58:36.529 --> 58:38.545
Don't worry, it's ours.

58:39.549 --> 58:40.549
Tarsem!

58:44.565 --> 58:47.525
- Jake.- Tarsem!

58:47.529 --> 58:52.533
- Kiri, Tuk, are you hurt?
-How did they find us?

58:52.561 --> 58:54.541
Children!

58:56.545 --> 59:01.549
- Mother!
- Tuk. Kiri. Lo'ak.

59:04.551 --> 59:07.539
Jake, are you okay?

59:07.543 --> 59:09.555
Yes, we are fine.

59:11.561 --> 59:13.529
Hello, Norm.

59:15.543 --> 59:17.545
So what?

59:19.555 --> 59:21.559
That?

59:25.561 --> 59:29.519
Well, now I can breathe here.

59:37.565 --> 59:41.537
Tuktirey. Kiri.

59:47.531 --> 59:51.525
Iron Sky, Blue 1 here.
We approach the city wall.

01:00:02.543 --> 01:00:05.521
Is he still with Sully?

01:00:05.525 --> 01:00:08.541
-I bet so.
-That's not my job.

01:00:08.545 --> 01:00:12.551
My job is to build the city and
send Amrita home as payment.

01:00:12.555 --> 01:00:16.559
And who establishes your tasks?
Those who have the global vision.

01:00:16.563 --> 01:00:22.521
How are we going to colonize the
planet if we can't breathe the air?

01:00:22.561 --> 01:00:25.559
If you want to find the
boy, you'll have to find Sully.

01:00:25.563 --> 01:00:29.519
-That's how it is.
-How many are missing?

01:00:29.523 --> 01:00:32.525
- Not many.
- That's what you said yesterday.

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:36.525
Here is the latest scan.
All this is mycelium.

01:00:36.529 --> 01:00:39.555
It is basically similar
to the forest network.

01:00:39.559 --> 01:00:45.565
It has embedded itself in your system
and changed it on a cellular level.

01:00:46.521 --> 01:00:50.519
His blood, his nervous system,
his lungs have changed...

01:00:50.523 --> 01:00:53.565
- Can you take it out?
- No. It's an endosymbiont.

01:00:54.521 --> 01:00:58.533
They keep each other
alive. We risk killing him.

01:00:59.519 --> 01:01:00.559
But look.

01:01:00.563 --> 01:01:05.535
He is healthy and strong.
Maybe it's a stroke of luck.

01:01:05.539 --> 01:01:07.553
A stroke of luck?

01:01:10.535 --> 01:01:13.549
What if RDA could recreate that?

01:01:13.553 --> 01:01:18.533
What if the entire population of Earth
could live here without wearing a mask?

01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:22.557
Jake, there's one more thing.

01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:27.523
Sit down, friend. Let me see.

01:01:27.527 --> 01:01:29.539
Don't move.

01:01:31.553 --> 01:01:34.547
-Look there.-What are you doing?

01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:37.547
- What is it?
- He is developing a kuru.

01:01:37.551 --> 01:01:40.533
- That?
- Yes.

01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:59.563
Grandma, are you there?

01:02:00.519 --> 01:02:03.539
I beg you, listen
to my little voice.

01:02:05.557 --> 01:02:10.549
I prayed to you in the
forest to save my friend.

01:02:10.553 --> 01:02:12.559
I prayed very fervently.

01:02:14.563 --> 01:02:17.523
But you didn't come.

01:02:18.521 --> 01:02:23.519
You didn't respond
so I had to do it myself.

01:02:23.523 --> 01:02:28.521
I don't know how. I
asked the roots for help.

01:02:28.525 --> 01:02:30.529
I don't remember...

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:35.559
No, you shouldn't reject me.

01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:41.565
Why am I like
this? How do I do it?

01:02:42.521 --> 01:02:43.563
Talk to me!

01:02:44.519 --> 01:02:46.519
I beg you.

01:02:47.519 --> 01:02:49.553
No, no, no...

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.531
Nope! No!

01:03:10.547 --> 01:03:11.555
Kiri…

01:03:11.559 --> 01:03:17.543
Eywa never came to me.
I don't know how I did it.

01:03:17.547 --> 01:03:19.525
Drink.

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:25.519
Kiri, you have been touched
by the hand of the Almighty.

01:03:25.555 --> 01:03:29.557
We've known it
since you were born.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:39.537
You are hiding something.

01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:44.537
I've felt it all my life.
Now tell me the truth.

01:03:44.541 --> 01:03:48.535
- Please.
- Tell him.

01:03:51.525 --> 01:03:52.555
The time has come.

01:03:55.519 --> 01:03:57.543
My son…

01:03:57.547 --> 01:04:02.519
You don't have a father, Kiri.

01:04:02.523 --> 01:04:03.553
That?

01:04:04.557 --> 01:04:07.559
Your mother, Grace's avatar...

01:04:07.563 --> 01:04:12.529
During the pregnancy, Norm
had some tests done. It was a slap…

01:04:12.533 --> 01:04:17.533
A parthenogenetic birth.
You are identical to the avatar.

01:04:17.537 --> 01:04:19.559
There is no father.

01:04:21.523 --> 01:04:24.563
-Am I a clone?-Grandson...

01:04:25.519 --> 01:04:28.551
It was Eywa's will.

01:04:28.555 --> 01:04:34.541
When the dreamwalker's body
lay here in Grandmother's hands...

01:04:36.525 --> 01:04:39.519
...a seed was planted.

01:04:51.545 --> 01:04:56.545
That's the scoundrel. Then
I'm even more monstrous.

01:04:56.549 --> 01:05:02.555
No, grandson. You
are the son of Eywa.

01:05:08.023 --> 01:05:11.987
I don't care how it happened.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:16.981
You are my girl. And I'm
the only father you need.

01:05:21.979 --> 01:05:24.999
If I'm something special, - -Why

01:05:25.003 --> 01:05:28.981
does Eywa turn a deaf ear to me?

01:05:30.007 --> 01:05:33.023
We don't know why,
but he left you out.

01:05:33.979 --> 01:05:36.013
- Like a firewall.
- A cipher.

01:05:36.017 --> 01:05:40.001
When you try to
penetrate, he bristles.

01:05:40.999 --> 01:05:45.011
Eywa has a path for you,
but she chooses to hide it.

01:05:45.015 --> 01:05:49.013
-Trust her.
-I have to find out what it is.

01:05:49.017 --> 01:05:52.989
No, you have to stop asking.

01:05:52.993 --> 01:05:57.985
Kiri, if you try to make
contact, you risk dying.

01:05:57.989 --> 01:06:01.017
If you do it underwater,
you will surely die.

01:06:05.985 --> 01:06:09.977
You can't stay here. If
the GDR catches him...

01:06:09.981 --> 01:06:12.015
The bows can't stop them.

01:06:12.019 --> 01:06:16.007
If it's a danger to the
town and everything else...

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:20.019
...then we must kill him.

01:06:23.983 --> 01:06:27.987
It's Spider. You
can come with us.

01:06:27.991 --> 01:06:31.015
To the reef. There
we can protect it.

01:06:32.017 --> 01:06:35.021
Toruk Makto knows better.

01:06:35.977 --> 01:06:38.995
Honey, it's not on.

01:06:38.999 --> 01:06:41.023
It's decided.

01:06:52.003 --> 01:06:53.999
Come closer to me

01:07:00.977 --> 01:07:05.005
Put me in the zone. Put me
in the area with the cannon.

01:07:05.009 --> 01:07:07.983
10 meters.

01:07:08.985 --> 01:07:10.023
So. And…

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:29.995
Straight to the lung.
He's bleeding out.

01:08:03.991 --> 01:08:09.993
A new demonic ship has
arrived. Several tulkun have died.

01:08:09.997 --> 01:08:12.005
It hurts me.

01:08:12.009 --> 01:08:16.013
Jake Sully, the outcast,
incites the young bulls.

01:08:16.017 --> 01:08:20.977
The tulkun have called a
council meeting to discuss it.

01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:22.999
You need to rest.

01:08:23.997 --> 01:08:28.001
-The one that needs to be removed.
-Children, come with me.

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:42.979
When I grow up I will
have my own illumination.

01:08:42.983 --> 01:08:45.993
Skxawng. It will be a
very small illumination.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:50.005
Wait and see. I'm going
to have my own wing.

01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:53.997
How did your daughter, - -Your

01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:58.993
mestizo daughter, who has no training...

01:09:00.003 --> 01:09:01.023
Wait here.

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:05.003
...could do what
no tsahìk could?

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:07.999
Do you doubt Eywa's will?

01:09:08.003 --> 01:09:11.021
- I'm tsahîk!  - Then prove it.

01:09:11.977 --> 01:09:16.003
Your herbs do nothing. The
herbs of my forest are better.

01:09:17.015 --> 01:09:20.019
I tell you to rest and
you don't listen to me.

01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:23.017
And then you blame the herbs.

01:09:24.003 --> 01:09:26.977
Don't move.

01:09:27.993 --> 01:09:29.009
Idiot!

01:09:29.013 --> 01:09:33.983
Be careful, tsahìk, or I'll
forget you're expecting a baby.

01:09:54.985 --> 01:09:57.983
The matriarch has spoken. It says: - that the marginalized

01:09:57.987 --> 01:10:01.985
continue to commit crimes against the Tulkun way of life.

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:07.017
He was ostracized for killing,
and now he's done it again.

01:10:08.005 --> 01:10:13.023
A demon ship attacked
and brought us death.

01:10:13.979 --> 01:10:16.019
- including Toruk Makto's son.

01:10:18.001 --> 01:10:21.021
- It wasn't Payakan's fault.
- Not now.

01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:30.021
She says he keeps
causing problems.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:32.987
- and put grills on the
heads of young people.

01:10:35.011 --> 01:10:37.003
That's a lie.

01:10:37.007 --> 01:10:40.997
She says he just wants
to sow more death.

01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:46.977
Why don't you say
something? Say something.

01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:55.981
She says the marginalized
should not stay in these waters.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:59.023
He must travel where
his song cannot be heard.

01:10:59.979 --> 01:11:01.979
Banished for life.

01:11:02.999 --> 01:11:05.023
That's not fair.

01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:09.009
It's decided.

01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:15.977
No! Payakan!

01:11:17.017 --> 01:11:20.021
Brother! Payakan!

01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:22.981
Brother!

01:11:28.983 --> 01:11:31.981
This is wrong!

01:11:32.999 --> 01:11:38.003
- You have no right to speak here.
- Payakan fought for us.

01:11:38.007 --> 01:11:40.995
He saved your daughter's life!

01:11:40.999 --> 01:11:44.001
You are not allowed to speak.
This is a council meeting.

01:11:44.005 --> 01:11:48.023
- The elders have spoken.
- The tulkun are being exterminated.

01:11:48.979 --> 01:11:53.983
-Lo'ak, that's good.
-Lo'ak tells the truth.

01:11:53.987 --> 01:12:00.011
Payakan fought for us.
More than any of you.

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:03.995
—He fought for us! —Sit
down! Take him away!

01:12:05.007 --> 01:12:08.013
-Make room for him.
-Dad, listen to him.

01:12:10.989 --> 01:12:13.003
What are you doing?

01:12:13.007 --> 01:12:17.003
- You never support me!
- Come here.

01:12:18.999 --> 01:12:20.997
The meeting continues.

01:12:23.019 --> 01:12:29.001
We are at war. Are you in?
Ignoring an order costs lives.

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:32.985
For Spider's sake,
we'll keep a low profile.

01:12:32.989 --> 01:12:37.985
- but that troublemaker would have
gotten the entire GDR to turn on us.

01:12:39.007 --> 01:12:41.991
You want to get rid of it.
That's why you stayed silent.

01:12:41.995 --> 01:12:45.993
It's unpredictable.
Just like you.

01:12:45.997 --> 01:12:50.003
If you hadn't had to save him,
your brother would still be...

01:12:56.985 --> 01:12:59.021
It wasn't my fault.

01:13:01.987 --> 01:13:04.003
It wasn't my fault!

01:13:07.985 --> 01:13:09.015
Look.

01:13:25.997 --> 01:13:28.015
Go after him, Jake.

01:13:31.983 --> 01:13:35.011
Otherwise you will
lose another child.

01:13:36.999 --> 01:13:40.005
I have nothing to say to you.

01:13:41.013 --> 01:13:44.013
Don't blame Lo'ak.

01:13:45.987 --> 01:13:50.021
You said you could
protect our family.

01:13:50.977 --> 01:13:55.007
- I thought we were safe here.
- Our son is dead.

01:13:55.011 --> 01:13:58.979
I made a mistake.

01:13:58.983 --> 01:14:03.009
Should I say that everything
I have done is wrong?

01:14:03.013 --> 01:14:07.011
That I was the one
who killed our son?

01:14:10.005 --> 01:14:16.019
However, we are here
to protect pale skin.

01:14:16.023 --> 01:14:17.991
A stranger.

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:21.987
If I had to choose between my family

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:24.003
and pale skin, - -I would kill him on the spot.

01:14:24.007 --> 01:14:29.003
Stop, stop, stop.
We're not going out.

01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:34.023
You've already chosen once
between your family and pale skin.

01:14:38.013 --> 01:14:42.023
You can't live
like this. You hate.

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:46.983
I hate them, Jake.

01:14:48.021 --> 01:14:52.003
I hate them. I hate
his small, pale hands.

01:14:52.999 --> 01:14:56.997
I hate his madness.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:03.017
I am human inside.
Do you hate me?

01:15:05.979 --> 01:15:08.013
I will always be a
stranger in your eyes, right?

01:15:08.017 --> 01:15:12.983
It doesn't matter how
long you live in this body.

01:15:12.987 --> 01:15:15.993
Do you hate your children?

01:15:15.997 --> 01:15:18.015
And his alien hands?

01:15:19.017 --> 01:15:21.007
No.

01:15:21.011 --> 01:15:25.981
Are you embarrassed when they
do something wrong or different?

01:15:27.985 --> 01:15:31.985
So it's because of
his human side, right?

01:15:32.999 --> 01:15:34.993
Yes.

01:15:52.979 --> 01:15:54.979
I'm sorry honey.

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:57.985
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:16:01.007 --> 01:16:04.987
We need to stay united now.

01:16:05.991 --> 01:16:08.995
Family is our strength.

01:16:30.983 --> 01:16:33.987
They say that when you touch

01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:37.019
steel, - - then it poisons the heart.

01:17:00.997 --> 01:17:02.989
Look!

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:06.019
- Brother.
- Look!

01:17:10.013 --> 01:17:15.991
He's still alive,
brother. We need you.

01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:19.005
-We love you.
-You have greatness within you.

01:17:34.989 --> 01:17:37.989
The strength of the
ancestors resides here.

01:17:41.995 --> 01:17:44.019
An arch can be repaired.

01:18:00.991 --> 01:18:03.007
Good, good.

01:18:10.999 --> 01:18:13.995
The moment of truth.

01:18:24.985 --> 01:18:26.977
Here we go.

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:32.995
- Can you feel it?
- Yes.

01:18:32.999 --> 01:18:36.023
- I have fins.
- Yes, you have them.

01:18:40.005 --> 01:18:41.993
That's it, monkey!

01:19:04.001 --> 01:19:06.977
Stay calm!

01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:10.985
Spider.

01:19:11.021 --> 01:19:14.993
- They don't know anything.
- Yes, they know.

01:19:15.983 --> 01:19:17.003
They just don't want to say it.

01:19:18.989 --> 01:19:22.003
We have one more
option, but it is extreme.

01:20:04.648 --> 01:20:07.632
You remember me, right?

01:20:09.632 --> 01:20:14.602
- Mine!
- I have something for your tsahìk.

01:20:14.606 --> 01:20:16.636
Take me to your tsahîk…

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:22.608
Oh, there's no need for
that. I'm watching you.

01:20:30.628 --> 01:20:32.602
Further!

01:20:39.608 --> 01:20:40.620
Tsahik!

01:20:45.624 --> 01:20:46.624
Tsahik!

01:21:03.612 --> 01:21:05.628
I can get a lot of them.

01:21:15.648 --> 01:21:18.636
What is your name, sky man?

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.638
Quaritch. Colonel
Miles Quaritch.

01:21:28.618 --> 01:21:30.632
If you touch me
again, I will kill you.

01:21:31.618 --> 01:21:35.612
You're not killing anyone.

01:21:35.616 --> 01:21:39.624
I don't agree with
that. Strip him.

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:05.626
Well done…

01:22:06.636 --> 01:22:08.642
...Quartz.

01:22:08.646 --> 01:22:13.644
You'll be next, scoundrel,
so think carefully.

01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:18.604
Come.

01:22:19.606 --> 01:22:21.606
Let's talk more inside.

01:22:27.624 --> 01:22:29.644
What are you doing, boss?

01:22:45.646 --> 01:22:47.606
Cozy.

01:22:49.646 --> 01:22:52.616
You understand...

01:22:53.624 --> 01:22:55.640
…everyone is lying to me.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:07.612
It is said that you can
make a stone tell the truth.

01:23:07.642 --> 01:23:12.608
You are looking for a man.
A man from heaven like you.

01:23:12.612 --> 01:23:16.622
Not like me. He is a traitor.

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:20.634
Then he must die.
★♪ MAZE HDRelease ♪★

01:23:21.626 --> 01:23:25.632
Varang can help you find it.

01:23:25.636 --> 01:23:28.622
And the other one you're looking for.

01:23:29.648 --> 01:23:33.602
This air respirator.

01:23:38.634 --> 01:23:43.640
But first I must see
your soul. Stay still.

01:23:45.622 --> 01:23:47.620
Stand still.

01:24:10.618 --> 01:24:12.604
Strong tobacco.

01:24:48.602 --> 01:24:53.618
This is the only uncorrupted
thing in this world.

01:24:56.642 --> 01:25:01.608
The fire came from the
mountain when I was a child.

01:25:02.614 --> 01:25:04.644
It burned our forest...

01:25:06.604 --> 01:25:08.618
...and took everything.

01:25:12.628 --> 01:25:16.612
My people were dying of hunger.

01:25:16.616 --> 01:25:19.602
They asked for help.

01:25:21.604 --> 01:25:24.630
But Eywa didn't come.

01:25:26.636 --> 01:25:30.612
So I looked for the fire...

01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:35.634
...and learned about its nature.

01:25:40.642 --> 01:25:43.648
I am the fire.

01:25:45.642 --> 01:25:51.612
By my hand my people became strong.

01:25:51.616 --> 01:25:55.646
We don't lie down to die just

01:25:56.602 --> 01:25:58.612
because Eywa - - turns her back on us.

01:25:59.622 --> 01:26:03.622
We turn our backs on Eywa.

01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:09.602
A weak mother for weak children.

01:26:11.608 --> 01:26:14.606
We are not nursing - -

01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:17.648
in the bosom of weakness.

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:23.634
Now…

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:30.628
...only true words
will leave your tongue.

01:26:35.648 --> 01:26:39.632
You have a strong
heart. You are not afraid.

01:26:42.636 --> 01:26:45.622
Av. It was not done well.

01:26:45.626 --> 01:26:49.620
I'll eat your heart, Quaritch.

01:26:54.606 --> 01:26:58.622
But first you have to answer me.

01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.602
What are you coming for?

01:27:08.604 --> 01:27:10.614
To talk to you.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.644
Do you want to serve me?

01:27:14.638 --> 01:27:20.606
I am no one's
servant. I need you.

01:27:21.604 --> 01:27:26.622
I don't need you.
But I could hug you.

01:27:26.626 --> 01:27:31.602
-like a slave to please me.

01:27:31.606 --> 01:27:37.630
It sounds very cozy, but
it's not what you're craving.

01:27:37.634 --> 01:27:40.618
What do I long for then?

01:27:41.628 --> 01:27:43.644
What you never had.

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:47.608
An equal.

01:27:51.602 --> 01:27:56.636
You want to spread the
fire to everyone, right?

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.604
I can get you weapons, radios...

01:28:00.648 --> 01:28:05.640
...and rocket launcher.
All that powerful magic.

01:28:05.644 --> 01:28:10.618
Give orders from a distance
and attack like lightning.

01:28:10.648 --> 01:28:16.626
All clans, as far as you

01:28:16.630 --> 01:28:19.648
can fly, - - will bow to Varang.

01:28:25.606 --> 01:28:27.634
If you're going
to punish Eywa...

01:28:28.646 --> 01:28:30.640
...you need me.

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.612
I see you.

01:28:39.610 --> 01:28:42.618
Damn, do that.

01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:06.604
When I contact you again, whenever that

01:30:06.608 --> 01:30:09.640
happens, - - I can show you the way to the spirit world.

01:30:11.632 --> 01:30:16.612
- Can't I go there now?
- No. Not without me.

01:30:16.616 --> 01:30:21.620
A sky person can't just get in.
The ancestors would have a foal.

01:30:31.624 --> 01:30:35.628
They have already begun to arrive
for the communion of the calves.

01:30:37.624 --> 01:30:41.644
One year old and newborn calves -

01:30:41.648 --> 01:30:45.608
-Must bond with Eywa for the first time.

01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:14.622
Let me see.

01:31:16.626 --> 01:31:20.604
Brilliant. It suits you well.

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:24.602
-Come to the party.- No, no, no.

01:31:24.606 --> 01:31:27.608
Then I will stay here with you.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:39.602
I shouldn't tell you this, but my sister tulkun says: - that

01:31:39.606 --> 01:31:44.610
they have heard Payakan calling very faintly to his natal clan.

01:31:44.614 --> 01:31:46.604
Where?

01:31:46.608 --> 01:31:48.648
The tulkun chant can be
heard from long distances.

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:51.608
Say it.

01:32:20.614 --> 01:32:22.610
Look…

01:32:25.636 --> 01:32:28.604
Goodbye, mother.

01:32:28.608 --> 01:32:30.618
Where are you going?

01:32:31.628 --> 01:32:33.626
Fresh out.

01:32:34.646 --> 01:32:38.610
There is something I have to do.

01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:46.626
Look!

01:32:48.602 --> 01:32:49.620
Look!

01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:52.646
Wait!

01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:55.610
Look!

01:33:01.646 --> 01:33:06.602
Yes, we must find
Payakan's brother.

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:14.620
We can't leave before communion.

01:33:14.624 --> 01:33:19.614
-I have to do it.
-We're leaving.

01:33:19.644 --> 01:33:21.630
All.

01:33:21.634 --> 01:33:26.610
Get weapons and food.
Not a word to anyone.

01:33:32.614 --> 01:33:35.608
Our children set out to find it.

01:33:35.612 --> 01:33:37.646
- Did you allow it?
- They didn't ask.

01:33:38.602 --> 01:33:40.642
Then the riders
must follow them.

01:33:40.646 --> 01:33:46.608
They must protect the calf
communion if the demon ships come.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:49.644
My child is completely alone.

01:33:49.648 --> 01:33:53.628
He will return home
when he is ready.

01:33:53.632 --> 01:33:56.622
That is your way.

01:34:00.608 --> 01:34:03.608
Look what he's done.

01:34:03.612 --> 01:34:08.612
The strength of the ancestors
runs through your child's veins.

01:34:08.616 --> 01:34:10.616
Believe it.

01:34:16.602 --> 01:34:18.614
The essence of water has no beginning...

01:34:21.634 --> 01:34:24.636
…and without end.
The sea is your home…

01:34:28.642 --> 01:34:30.644
...before your birth...

01:34:36.626 --> 01:34:38.638
...and after your death.

01:35:01.604 --> 01:35:05.614
Where is the one called Toruk Makto?

01:35:05.935 --> 01:35:07.973
How many fish are there
in the sea? One, two.

01:35:07.977 --> 01:35:11.951
How many birds are there
in the sky? One two three.

01:35:12.959 --> 01:35:16.981
Couldn't you have asked Eywa
to make me taller? Or more blue?

01:35:17.937 --> 01:35:21.961
No. I was busy saving
your life, skxawng.

01:35:21.965 --> 01:35:24.977
Just a few centimeters.

01:35:26.947 --> 01:35:29.981
The old woman can do everything.

01:35:31.943 --> 01:35:35.961
You are perfect, exactly the way you are.

01:35:54.935 --> 01:35:56.963
Come on, monkey.

01:35:58.949 --> 01:36:02.935
The next step will be to
learn how to ride a glider.

01:36:02.939 --> 01:36:05.955
So that you can become a
powerful warrior and protect us.

01:36:05.959 --> 01:36:09.975
It's not the size that
counts but the doing.

01:36:09.979 --> 01:36:11.967
And now what?

01:36:18.943 --> 01:36:20.943
Runs!  Runs!

01:36:29.955 --> 01:36:31.947
Run, run!

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:34.981
- Spider!  - Here, idiots!

01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:41.955
Come on!  Skxawng!  This way, bastard!

01:36:43.955 --> 01:36:46.979
Is that the only thing you're good for?

01:36:52.959 --> 01:36:58.953
So be careful with that
knife. Someone could get hurt.

01:36:59.945 --> 01:37:00.979
Air respirator.

01:37:15.967 --> 01:37:17.981
-We are flying.- Take off!

01:37:18.973 --> 01:37:22.937
Dragonfly, Blue 1 here.  May you be well.

01:37:36.953 --> 01:37:37.971
Hit!

01:37:45.949 --> 01:37:47.979
- They are imprisoning us.  - To arms!

01:37:48.935 --> 01:37:51.971
- Where is your sister?  -Where are Kiri and Spider?

01:37:54.955 --> 01:37:55.967
Sheep!

01:37:55.971 --> 01:37:59.969
- Where is Spider?  - Colonel Blue took it.

01:38:12.945 --> 01:38:14.953
Tomato it

01:38:33.955 --> 01:38:35.943
Stay calm.

01:38:35.947 --> 01:38:39.957
Fearless.  Fearless.

01:38:46.957 --> 01:38:48.949
Jake Sully!

01:38:49.947 --> 01:38:52.969
- Get the girls out of here.  - I'm not going to leave them.

01:38:52.973 --> 01:38:56.977
They have Spider.  Nothing stops them anymore.

01:38:56.981 --> 01:39:02.963
-People are going to die.  -You can't ask me this.

01:39:04.945 --> 01:39:10.939
—It's the only solution.  "Jake Sully!"  Come freely!

01:39:10.943 --> 01:39:12.945
You have to go now.

01:39:12.949 --> 01:39:16.947
Take your sister and hide!  Now!

01:39:17.967 --> 01:39:23.943
- I'll stay.  I will kill many.  - Don't use that bow.

01:39:23.947 --> 01:39:25.965
Swear to me.

01:39:27.963 --> 01:39:31.959
I know it's here.  Hand it over.

01:39:31.963 --> 01:39:36.961
He is metkayina.  One of us.  He is one of us!

01:39:36.965 --> 01:39:40.953
- Set fire to something.  - Dragon 24…

01:39:40.957 --> 01:39:43.975
- Use a firearm.  - Switch to firearm.

01:40:00.943 --> 01:40:03.945
I love Jake Sully!

01:40:03.949 --> 01:40:07.945
The fire is still!
The fire is still!

01:40:08.935 --> 01:40:09.959
The fire is at rest.

01:40:10.955 --> 01:40:12.941
Received.

01:40:14.935 --> 01:40:17.937
This is my way, brother.

01:40:33.967 --> 01:40:37.943
- Colonel.
- Corporal.

01:40:37.947 --> 01:40:41.945
Take me and leave
the others alone.

01:40:41.949 --> 01:40:45.977
That's not enough. I
want the lady with me.

01:40:49.937 --> 01:40:54.939
- You got me.
- Both, or I'll blow up the city.

01:40:54.979 --> 01:40:57.951
Pregnant women and children.

01:40:57.955 --> 01:41:01.967
I photograph old women to pickle
fish because I am very happy.

01:41:01.971 --> 01:41:08.945
And my friends, I really want to
grab your neck and rip your scalp off.

01:41:24.939 --> 01:41:27.975
Oh really? Is that
what you want?

01:41:28.959 --> 01:41:34.957
When I let go of my arm, you and your new
lady will die. You, especially, will die.

01:41:34.961 --> 01:41:37.939
Then you die too.

01:41:37.943 --> 01:41:41.973
Maybe. But you're
unlikely to hit us all.

01:41:41.977 --> 01:41:46.963
Maybe we will attack and the helicopters
will hesitate because we look alike.

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:49.973
And then when
you ask for mercy...

01:41:51.945 --> 01:41:53.937
...I'm going to scalp you.

01:41:53.971 --> 01:41:59.947
Well, I don't know if
you're smart or stupid.

01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:02.949
You've never seemed
very intelligent to me.

01:42:02.977 --> 01:42:09.935
Give me your soldier's
word. Security for my people.

01:42:09.963 --> 01:42:11.957
Burn them, Quaritch.

01:42:20.959 --> 01:42:22.955
Do we have a deal?

01:42:27.939 --> 01:42:31.953
Above. A little finger lift?

01:42:40.977 --> 01:42:43.947
Take it I

01:42:43.951 --> 01:42:44.979
turn around.

01:42:50.959 --> 01:42:52.959
Forward.

01:43:12.961 --> 01:43:15.981
See you later, Mrs.

01:43:19.941 --> 01:43:20.943
Sully.

01:44:03.953 --> 01:44:07.977
Departure.

01:44:07.981 --> 01:44:09.951
- What's happening?
- We are being attacked by Fury Riders.

01:44:09.955 --> 01:44:12.963
Take them down. Our
weapons are locked.

01:44:13.969 --> 01:44:16.935
They have IFF marks.
- Expand it.

01:45:05.939 --> 01:45:07.963
- Set the objective.

01:45:07.967 --> 01:45:10.971
Okay, hold it.
- Calm down, calm down.  - Come here!

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.965
-Jake!
- Forward.

01:45:14.969 --> 01:45:17.941
Jake!  Jake!

01:45:20.967 --> 01:45:22.947
Jake!

01:45:38.973 --> 01:45:44.953
Mission accomplished.  Jake Sully aka Toruk Makto.

01:45:59.941 --> 01:46:05.979
You not only distribute weapons, but also bring enemies home.

01:46:07.937 --> 01:46:09.969
Not enemies.  Allies.

01:46:10.959 --> 01:46:15.967
General Ardmore, this is Varang, the tsahìk of the Mangkwan tribe.

01:46:18.945 --> 01:46:24.957
Listen, Colonel Blackfoot, I want those barbarians away from my base.

01:46:24.961 --> 01:46:28.977
Right now.  That also applies to your little friend.

01:46:34.953 --> 01:46:37.975
Don't be stupid, Madam General.

01:46:37.979 --> 01:46:40.939
Take victory.

01:46:41.949 --> 01:46:44.951
We got it!

01:46:46.953 --> 01:46:48.953
An era has ended.

01:47:06.939 --> 01:47:07.979
Tsahik.

01:47:09.971 --> 01:47:11.965
Come here.

01:47:28.939 --> 01:47:29.947
Calm.

01:47:36.947 --> 01:47:39.937
Now comes a small point.

01:47:39.941 --> 01:47:40.979
Stay still.

01:47:42.967 --> 01:47:44.981
So it's just before.

01:47:45.937 --> 01:47:46.975
keep it there

01:47:53.074 --> 01:47:55.074
Payakan!

01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:59.092
Payakan!

01:48:05.102 --> 01:48:08.100
They say that the sea leaves us clean.

01:48:08.104 --> 01:48:10.100
Payakan!

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:16.074
-It's Lo'ak.  -It's him!

01:48:16.078 --> 01:48:18.090
Skxawng, over here!

01:48:18.094 --> 01:48:20.082
Tsireya!

01:48:23.106 --> 01:48:27.098
They also say that if you see the deep-sea tsyonges...

01:48:30.102 --> 01:48:33.106
...they are spirits that come to judge you.

01:48:45.072 --> 01:48:46.104
Tsyonger!

01:50:02.074 --> 01:50:06.096
Look!  Look!  Look!

01:50:10.086 --> 01:50:12.100
Tsireya.

01:50:17.082 --> 01:50:19.098
Thank you grandma.

01:50:19.102 --> 01:50:22.100
-Now let him breathe.
-Let it go.

01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:31.070
- You came and saved me.
- My friend's way is my way.

01:50:34.094 --> 01:50:37.104
- Is that your sister?
- Yes.

01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:42.082
- Can you hear Payakan?
- He's on his way here.

01:50:49.062 --> 01:50:51.068
What's new?

01:50:51.072 --> 01:50:55.076
-The mycelium that lives in it...
-Is there something alive in it?

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:58.104
Yes. An endosymbiont that
regulates ion exchange...

01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:02.106
It doesn't matter how it
works. Can we reproduce it?

01:51:08.106 --> 01:51:10.094
Block me!

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:18.078
I asked the dresses
to leave you alone.

01:51:18.082 --> 01:51:20.082
Where's Jake?

01:51:20.086 --> 01:51:25.066
In a cage where it belongs.
Here's a hamburger.

01:51:26.076 --> 01:51:30.084
- You're not hurting him.
- You're not worried anymore.

01:51:30.088 --> 01:51:34.074
You are with me
now. I am your father.

01:51:34.078 --> 01:51:36.092
My father is dead.

01:51:36.096 --> 01:51:40.100
You are just an artificial thing
equipped with its memories.

01:51:40.104 --> 01:51:45.082
No, I'm still me.
I've been searching.

01:51:45.086 --> 01:51:50.060
See. "Colonel Miles Quaritch."

01:51:50.064 --> 01:51:52.066
"Deceased."

01:51:55.104 --> 01:52:01.072
We didn't get to chat much
when we were in the jungle, but...

01:52:01.076 --> 01:52:07.072
- I owe you a thank you. You
pulled me out of a sinking ship.

01:52:07.076 --> 01:52:11.092
-You saved my
life.-Now I regret it.

01:52:13.072 --> 01:52:17.092
Maybe it's true. Maybe not.

01:52:17.096 --> 01:52:20.104
Whatever happens, I am in your debt.

01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:27.066
And I must say that I am proud of you.

01:52:29.088 --> 01:52:35.092
You are amazing. You
have guts and brains.

01:52:35.096 --> 01:52:39.080
- and you are brave as a lion.

01:52:39.084 --> 01:52:42.096
I see myself in you.

01:52:44.062 --> 01:52:47.106
But above all I see your mother in you.

01:52:49.068 --> 01:52:52.096
She was a Balstyrian.

01:52:54.078 --> 01:52:57.088
It's hard to live with, but...

01:52:57.092 --> 01:53:01.082
- I loved her. And
how she loved you.

01:53:04.072 --> 01:53:07.088
It was very difficult for
him to get on that helicopter.

01:53:07.092 --> 01:53:11.094
- fly into battle and leave
your little son behind.

01:53:14.082 --> 01:53:18.068
Your mother died a hero.

01:53:18.072 --> 01:53:21.068
You have that inside too.

01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:29.096
But enough of that. I just came
to tell you that I'm here to help you.

01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:32.068
If you need me...

01:53:34.084 --> 01:53:36.060
...then I'm here.

01:53:39.090 --> 01:53:41.066
Can I keep it?

01:53:51.064 --> 01:53:52.100
Now eat something.

01:54:04.072 --> 01:54:06.062
Brother!

01:54:12.084 --> 01:54:15.068
I see you, brother.

01:54:20.064 --> 01:54:23.062
What's in the way?

01:54:27.076 --> 01:54:29.098
Didn't find your birth clan?

01:54:57.088 --> 01:55:02.102
The Tulkuns have begun to arrive,
but most of them are during the eclipse.

01:55:02.106 --> 01:55:06.090
It's the day after tomorrow.
That's when we attack.

01:55:06.094 --> 01:55:08.100
Just a moment.

01:55:08.104 --> 01:55:13.082
You talk about mass killings.
The extermination of entire herds.

01:55:13.086 --> 01:55:17.074
That is, we can meet an
entire year's quota in one day.

01:55:17.078 --> 01:55:21.084
- They are intelligent beings.
-Who are you?

01:55:21.088 --> 01:55:26.066
Ian Garvin, marine biologist.

01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:31.080
The creatures have culture and
music, and they give each other names.

01:55:31.084 --> 01:55:35.090
This meeting is a
spiritual event for them.

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:40.076
-Get off the ivory tower.-I
didn't agree with this.

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.062
Thank you, Dr. Garvin. Your
protest has been taken into account.

01:55:44.066 --> 01:55:46.062
- Is it recorded?
- Yes.

01:55:46.066 --> 01:55:50.098
Submarines and
speedboats, you form a chain.

01:55:50.102 --> 01:55:56.098
You drive the animals inland, where a
natural bottleneck forms to the islands.

01:55:58.066 --> 01:56:00.078
JAKE SULLY: TRAITOR TO HUMANITY

01:56:06.078 --> 01:56:07.102
I guess we have it.

01:56:09.094 --> 01:56:10.104
Make space!

01:56:12.094 --> 01:56:13.094
Open.

01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:16.102
Their weapons.

01:56:25.068 --> 01:56:29.086
It's over, Jake.  Tomorrow at 6 a.m.

01:56:32.068 --> 01:56:36.080
Varang wants your heart, but I'll keep it the old way.

01:56:36.084 --> 01:56:41.074
Platoon.  Selfridge says it looks better.

01:56:42.072 --> 01:56:44.102
And you're fumbling for the ties.

01:56:46.104 --> 01:56:49.084
It's not about them.

01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:54.090
It's about you and me.

01:56:54.094 --> 01:56:58.062
About a soldier who abused my trust.

01:56:58.066 --> 01:57:01.090
About the men and women I lost.

01:57:05.098 --> 01:57:08.074
Memories of a dead man.

01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:14.086
Miles Quaritch is gone.

01:57:14.090 --> 01:57:19.078
You are free and there is a whole world out there.

01:57:19.082 --> 01:57:24.096
There are things that ties can never understand.

01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:28.068
The Na'vi call it "kame."  To see.

01:57:39.086 --> 01:57:42.074
Then you will see this world.

01:57:44.078 --> 01:57:46.084
Look at yourself.

01:57:49.106 --> 01:57:52.080
I see you -

01:57:52.084 --> 01:57:54.088
- at 6 o'clock.

01:58:49.057 --> 01:58:54.053
-Last time I bought two.  -Yes, the ugliest in the whole town.

01:59:14.045 --> 01:59:16.059
Hands against the wall!

01:59:21.047 --> 01:59:23.047
- So.  - Close the door.

01:59:35.051 --> 01:59:39.023
He's just one of Quaritch's scouts.

02:00:08.029 --> 02:00:09.063
keep an eye on me

02:00:31.057 --> 02:00:35.057
You have a PhD.
How difficult can it be?

02:00:55.045 --> 02:00:57.033
Look there now.

02:01:00.059 --> 02:01:02.035
Hi gorgeous.

02:01:05.035 --> 02:01:07.049
She loves me.

02:01:14.045 --> 02:01:16.059
Quartz.

02:01:20.033 --> 02:01:24.041
We are the fire. Mangkwan!

02:01:29.051 --> 02:01:32.049
Cuaritch!  Cuaritch!

02:01:35.065 --> 02:01:39.055
Not a sound, witch.
Where's Jake Sully?

02:01:39.059 --> 02:01:43.021
The wife. Loyal to her husband.

02:01:43.025 --> 02:01:46.023
Say it or I'll interrupt you.

02:01:49.025 --> 02:01:53.029
Where?  I won't ask again.

02:01:55.041 --> 02:01:58.051
No, wait.

02:01:58.055 --> 02:02:02.035
Outside the camp.
In an animal cage.

02:02:02.039 --> 02:02:06.033
Take me there. Where?

02:02:06.037 --> 02:02:07.063
Disgusting!

02:02:11.055 --> 02:02:14.029
Come join us!

02:02:24.065 --> 02:02:28.023
- After her!  - Take his heart!

02:02:41.035 --> 02:02:42.061
Fly!

02:02:59.029 --> 02:03:00.061
Take refuge!

02:03:14.041 --> 02:03:16.019
Jake!

02:03:17.045 --> 02:03:20.029
- Madam General...
- I'm busy.

02:03:20.033 --> 02:03:25.047
It's important. The boy is loose
and I have to get him back alive.

02:03:34.037 --> 02:03:35.045
Fuck him.

02:04:27.051 --> 02:04:31.035
Off the field, guys. Move!

02:04:31.039 --> 02:04:33.033
Shoot, shoot!

02:04:35.029 --> 02:04:36.063
Off the field!

02:04:44.025 --> 02:04:45.041
Shovel down.

02:04:52.027 --> 02:04:53.041
Run, Jake.

02:04:57.031 --> 02:04:58.047
Screw him!

02:05:01.063 --> 02:05:02.065
Back.

02:05:06.057 --> 02:05:07.065
Such.

02:05:12.045 --> 02:05:16.025
- Shoot the cameras!
- Keep up with me!

02:05:24.023 --> 02:05:25.065
Stay up to date with me.

02:05:30.061 --> 02:05:33.055
What am I doing?

02:05:54.049 --> 02:05:57.049
Has my protest already been
taken into account, idiots?

02:06:06.023 --> 02:06:09.033
Jake, over here.

02:06:09.037 --> 02:06:11.047
No, this way.

02:06:14.051 --> 02:06:17.065
Ian Garvin, marine biologist.

02:06:18.021 --> 02:06:24.033
I love everything you do. Right
now I feel a little overwhelmed.

02:06:24.037 --> 02:06:27.057
Don't worry. What is the plan?

02:06:27.061 --> 02:06:31.037
I haven't thought beyond this.

02:06:31.041 --> 02:06:35.031
Then it's Neytiri. Come on.

02:06:39.063 --> 02:06:41.063
Fly to!

02:06:44.027 --> 02:06:45.057
Fly, fly!

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:56.047
Why do you do this?

02:06:56.051 --> 02:07:00.063
They are planning a large-scale
tulku hunt for the day after tomorrow.

02:07:01.019 --> 02:07:06.057
- They are putting in all the boats.
- The communion of the calf.

02:07:08.019 --> 02:07:11.023
You are the only one
who can stop them.

02:07:12.037 --> 02:07:14.021
Come.

02:07:23.031 --> 02:07:25.063
SATA, SSH.

02:07:27.063 --> 02:07:29.045
Come on.

02:07:36.019 --> 02:07:39.019
Wait. Now!

02:07:48.061 --> 02:07:50.039
Hurry up!

02:07:58.035 --> 02:08:02.053
-Lima 16 has caught one.
-Is that Sully?

02:08:02.057 --> 02:08:06.065
- Switch to missiles.
- Switch to missiles.

02:08:07.021 --> 02:08:08.049
Do you remember me?

02:08:11.021 --> 02:08:14.047
Idiot! I don't need this.

02:08:15.063 --> 02:08:18.033
What are you going
to do? Shoot me?

02:08:19.059 --> 02:08:24.035
It is the one that breathes
air. He's in the line of fire.

02:08:24.039 --> 02:08:26.023
You must not shoot!

02:08:27.033 --> 02:08:31.019
Lima 16, the fire is on
hold. Keep it focused.

02:08:31.023 --> 02:08:34.033
Send reinforcements there.

02:08:34.037 --> 02:08:38.029
You don't shoot me
because you can't.

02:08:38.033 --> 02:08:41.027
In exchange, you
can kick my ass.

02:08:42.045 --> 02:08:46.031
Come on, Jake! Run, run, run!

02:08:48.029 --> 02:08:51.041
He's running west. The
line of fire remains blocked.

02:08:53.021 --> 02:08:55.051
Follow me.

02:09:00.019 --> 02:09:01.035
Follow us!

02:09:01.039 --> 02:09:04.059
That's enough. Lima 16, shoot.

02:09:04.063 --> 02:09:06.061
- No!
- Throw it out.

02:09:06.065 --> 02:09:10.047
- Ignore that order.
- Run, run, run!

02:09:11.055 --> 02:09:16.019
- Lima 16, clean fire.
- I've lost sight of them.

02:09:17.045 --> 02:09:20.019
-He's turning around.
-Come on.

02:09:20.023 --> 02:09:25.025
- Blue 1 here. Fire waiting.
- Lima 16, your fire is clear.

02:09:25.029 --> 02:09:27.029
16 opens fire.

02:09:33.029 --> 02:09:34.039
Below!

02:09:43.035 --> 02:09:45.019
Hi Jake!

02:09:45.023 --> 02:09:46.033
Neytiri!

02:09:47.053 --> 02:09:51.023
Honey, I don't know whether
to kiss you or scold you.

02:09:51.027 --> 02:09:53.049
You're wasting your time.

02:09:53.053 --> 02:09:55.041
Jump up.

02:09:57.039 --> 02:09:59.019
Here we go.

02:10:12.886 --> 02:10:14.894
Land anywhere.

02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:40.864
I really need to pee.

02:10:40.868 --> 02:10:43.852
You landed just in time.

02:10:43.856 --> 02:10:47.860
What's happening?
Why do we stop?

02:10:51.888 --> 02:10:56.854
They didn't even put a
zipper on it. What stupidity.

02:10:56.858 --> 02:10:59.852
Good idea. First he drinks
and then pees in the water.

02:10:59.856 --> 02:11:01.888
What's up, Jake?

02:11:01.892 --> 02:11:05.892
I made a mistake.
We can't protect it.

02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:09.876
It itches me a lot.

02:11:10.886 --> 02:11:16.852
Quaritch has a woman who
can find us wherever we are.

02:11:16.856 --> 02:11:19.890
They want to
capture it and study it.

02:11:19.894 --> 02:11:24.860
And when humans can breathe our air, - -

02:11:24.864 --> 02:11:26.898
Will they infect our world?  - - and ruin

02:11:27.854 --> 02:11:32.868
the forests and oceans, just as they did on Earth.

02:11:32.872 --> 02:11:38.864
The Na'vi people will be exterminated.
The Tulkun will be exterminated.

02:11:38.868 --> 02:11:42.882
And I can't allow that.

02:11:42.886 --> 02:11:45.888
Are you hungry for dogs too?

02:11:51.852 --> 02:11:53.852
You were right.

02:11:57.868 --> 02:11:59.874
We have to do it.

02:12:00.892 --> 02:12:02.882
Jake…

02:12:04.862 --> 02:12:06.882
He saved your life.

02:12:17.854 --> 02:12:19.866
There is nothing else to do.

02:12:31.872 --> 02:12:32.884
Spider…

02:12:34.876 --> 02:12:36.860
Come here.

02:12:42.856 --> 02:12:43.886
So what?

02:12:47.852 --> 02:12:48.892
What's happening?

02:12:48.896 --> 02:12:51.852
Come with me.

02:12:52.886 --> 02:12:54.878
Come.

02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:07.880
- I have to pee.
- Stay close to me.

02:13:15.898 --> 02:13:19.894
- Where are we going?
- Silence.

02:13:34.864 --> 02:13:37.860
Is it something serious?

02:13:49.852 --> 02:13:51.890
Come here.

02:13:55.866 --> 02:13:57.890
It's nice here.

02:13:57.894 --> 02:14:01.856
On your knees. On your knees.

02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:03.868
Get on your knees!

02:14:03.872 --> 02:14:07.864
Don't do it, Jake, don't do it.

02:14:07.868 --> 02:14:10.852
Look ahead. Don't move.

02:14:10.856 --> 02:14:13.868
Don't do it. There's no need.

02:14:14.894 --> 02:14:16.866
No.

02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:19.866
Grandma, are you here?

02:14:20.876 --> 02:14:22.884
No need Guide my

02:14:22.888 --> 02:14:26.860
hand. Give me strength.

02:14:26.864 --> 02:14:30.854
No! Aren't you going to stop?

02:14:30.858 --> 02:14:32.886
Don't look at me.

02:14:34.898 --> 02:14:38.864
-Forgive me.
-I'll behave well.

02:14:38.868 --> 02:14:44.860
May your spirit go to Eywa and
your body return to the forest.

02:14:44.864 --> 02:14:49.896
- To maintain the balance of life.
May the ancestors welcome you.

02:15:04.886 --> 02:15:06.882
No.

02:15:06.886 --> 02:15:12.854
May the ancestors embrace
you and sing your song.

02:15:12.858 --> 02:15:17.890
I already know I'm going
home with Eywa. No problem.

02:15:17.894 --> 02:15:19.888
But…

02:15:22.868 --> 02:15:24.896
...do you still love me?

02:15:25.888 --> 02:15:28.892
With all my heart.

02:16:11.866 --> 02:16:12.894
Hi Jake!

02:16:23.888 --> 02:16:25.896
I see you.

02:16:33.864 --> 02:16:38.856
Whatever happens,
this is not the solution.

02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:42.856
We will find another solution.

02:16:57.858 --> 02:17:02.852
My father knew deep down
that there was only one way.

02:17:09.856 --> 02:17:15.872
No matter what you imagine yourself to be as a

02:17:15.876 --> 02:17:18.894
father or as a husband, - you always turn it back on.

02:17:38.856 --> 02:17:41.866
Good morning, old friend.

02:17:42.866 --> 02:17:44.894
Toruk loved my father.

02:17:47.856 --> 02:17:53.874
Together they were somewhat larger,
and when they flew, they splashed blood.

02:17:56.874 --> 02:17:58.858
He comes.

02:18:22.864 --> 02:18:24.884
Toruk Makto!

02:18:27.856 --> 02:18:30.876
No, no, get up.

02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:32.882
Get up.

02:18:33.866 --> 02:18:35.882
Tax…

02:18:35.886 --> 02:18:38.886
It's okay.

02:18:40.874 --> 02:18:44.886
Go out to all the clans within
a day's travel and tell them...

02:18:47.878 --> 02:18:49.888
...that Toruk Makto
summons them.

02:18:51.890 --> 02:18:54.898
Tell them - -that

02:18:55.854 --> 02:18:57.858
the day is over.

02:19:36.874 --> 02:19:40.892
And so it was that Toruk Makto returned,

02:19:40.896 --> 02:19:44.894
- - and my father reunited the clans.

02:19:44.898 --> 02:19:47.854
He gave great speeches.

02:19:47.858 --> 02:19:51.856
Many arrows together
cannot be broken.

02:19:52.884 --> 02:19:54.890
We cannot be broken!

02:20:02.878 --> 02:20:05.886
But he knew it wasn't enough.

02:20:22.898 --> 02:20:27.864
Great Matriarch. Wise Elders.

02:20:27.898 --> 02:20:31.878
The sky people are
on their way here.

02:20:31.882 --> 02:20:36.860
Now and here. They are
coming to kill our Tulkun family.

02:20:36.864 --> 02:20:40.852
I beg you. Fight with us.

02:20:48.854 --> 02:20:49.876
She says: We respect Toruk

02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:54.862
Makto, but our customs are ancient.

02:20:57.888 --> 02:21:02.862
We believe that killing
only leads to more killing.

02:21:02.866 --> 02:21:05.878
- in a spiral that
grows without end."

02:21:07.884 --> 02:21:10.872
Listen to my words.

02:21:10.876 --> 02:21:16.864
The sky people will not heal
until the last tulkun is placed.

02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:24.880
Look!

02:21:41.864 --> 02:21:44.852
Dad, wait.

02:21:44.856 --> 02:21:49.890
—As a Tulkun brother, I have the right to
speak. —Lo'ak tells the truth. Listen to it.

02:21:49.894 --> 02:21:51.870
Tsireya!

02:21:56.852 --> 02:22:01.886
His brother has been ostracized.
You have no rights here.

02:22:03.886 --> 02:22:08.856
If he's an outcast, so am I.

02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:12.864
- And I'm an outcast.
- Daughter, shut up.

02:22:12.868 --> 02:22:16.864
No! You'll never see me again.

02:22:17.890 --> 02:22:21.880
- And my brother and I are outcasts.
- Aonung!

02:22:21.884 --> 02:22:25.884
And we are also marginalized.

02:22:37.868 --> 02:22:40.886
She says you have to talk.

02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:48.896
Listen to my words. My brother
went out to protect his home clan.

02:22:49.852 --> 02:22:53.878
- but his clan had been wiped
out by the demonic ships.

02:22:53.882 --> 02:22:58.886
Ta'nok was the only one who
survived because she accepted the fight.

02:22:58.890 --> 02:23:00.896
Come closer.

02:23:26.896 --> 02:23:28.870
Ta'nok says: "I speak for

02:23:28.874 --> 02:23:33.882
dead mothers and dead calves."

02:23:39.878 --> 02:23:43.878
I speak for my people
and all our songs...

02:23:44.894 --> 02:23:48.884
...which is gone forever.

02:23:53.882 --> 02:23:59.896
I am the last one. The
blind witness of our doom.

02:24:04.862 --> 02:24:10.880
The customs of the tulkun must change.
Payakan shows us the way forward.

02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:19.864
“We must take on the fight.

02:24:19.886 --> 02:24:21.882
” We must take up the fight!

02:24:38.884 --> 02:24:43.856
- What did he say?
- They are discussing it.

02:24:44.037 --> 02:24:46.041
Take a look.

02:24:46.045 --> 02:24:51.023
There are hundreds of
them. Look how many are old.

02:24:51.027 --> 02:24:54.057
Old is good because
it grows throughout life.

02:24:55.049 --> 02:24:58.041
And that means more amrita.

02:24:58.045 --> 02:25:02.041
Look at this bastard. It
must be 100 meters long.

02:25:03.043 --> 02:25:07.055
You're doing the briefing without
me. It must be an oversight.

02:25:07.059 --> 02:25:10.035
No, it's not.

02:25:10.039 --> 02:25:15.057
After the Sully fiasco, you're done
for, Colonel. You are under house arrest.

02:25:16.049 --> 02:25:21.057
Forget it. Sully will be
there, and Spider too.

02:25:21.061 --> 02:25:26.019
The one who also
has one foot in jail.

02:25:26.023 --> 02:25:30.021
- Maybe you would like to call dad?
- To the president of the board?

02:25:31.053 --> 02:25:34.031
I can still complete
the mission.

02:25:34.035 --> 02:25:40.057
You are a disgrace to your uniform.
Do you remember what a uniform is?

02:25:41.047 --> 02:25:44.057
They have neighborhood
arrest. Permanent.

02:26:01.019 --> 02:26:03.037
Why are you here, bitch?

02:26:04.057 --> 02:26:07.035
Pray, tsahìk.

02:26:11.019 --> 02:26:13.027
No, girl.

02:26:16.021 --> 02:26:18.031
Why are you here among us?

02:26:21.023 --> 02:26:24.039
Maybe it was predestined.

02:26:26.045 --> 02:26:31.053
Only the one who has been chosen
will be able to invoke the Warrior Mother.

02:26:35.043 --> 02:26:39.025
Tsahìk, you are in labor.

02:26:39.029 --> 02:26:43.033
I fear we won't survive this.

02:26:48.027 --> 02:26:49.055
Kiri…

02:26:52.027 --> 02:26:54.045
Listen to my words.

02:26:54.049 --> 02:26:59.025
If there's something you can

02:26:59.029 --> 02:27:01.039
do, - -Then you should do it.

02:27:04.035 --> 02:27:08.029
Your heart is strong.

02:27:08.033 --> 02:27:10.027
Here.

02:27:10.031 --> 02:27:15.039
- Should I travel with you?
- No, you have to stay here.

02:27:15.043 --> 02:27:21.053
I need to know that you are safe. Stay in
your position no matter what. Understood?

02:27:22.043 --> 02:27:25.025
Lima Charlie, Sr.

02:27:30.035 --> 02:27:35.021
If Dad and I don't come back,
you're taking Spider and the girls.

02:27:35.025 --> 02:27:38.043
- and run away
as far as you can.

02:28:24.059 --> 02:28:26.055
Shut up.

02:28:31.039 --> 02:28:34.023
The flow is absolutely crazy.

02:28:34.027 --> 02:28:38.041
Keep your distance. That
devil will take your head off.

02:28:38.045 --> 02:28:40.055
It has been received.

02:28:57.039 --> 02:29:01.059
Alright guys, let's
have some fun.

02:29:01.063 --> 02:29:04.035
Then the bus runs!

02:29:14.049 --> 02:29:16.053
Submarines in the bathtub.

02:29:26.057 --> 02:29:29.025
- Yes please!
- Come on!

02:29:38.059 --> 02:29:40.037
Do you see any enemies?

02:29:40.041 --> 02:29:44.045
No. There is no activity. And
the animals just do their thing.

02:29:46.041 --> 02:29:48.065
Fish in a barrel, Scoresby.

02:29:49.053 --> 02:29:51.037
Wait.

02:29:54.033 --> 02:29:57.057
Wait, wait...

02:29:58.059 --> 02:30:00.035
Wait.

02:30:09.063 --> 02:30:12.019
Wait a minute.

02:30:12.023 --> 02:30:16.047
There are no bulls
or large females.

02:30:16.051 --> 02:30:18.057
Not adults.

02:30:20.039 --> 02:30:22.045
Stop for a moment.

02:30:22.049 --> 02:30:25.021
I collect a large signature.

02:30:25.025 --> 02:30:30.033
- Tulkuns, and they are big.
- Many Tulkuns on the way!

02:30:42.063 --> 02:30:46.025
Scoresby, you said
they weren't aggressive.

02:30:46.029 --> 02:30:49.051
Neither do they. Normally.

02:30:59.045 --> 02:31:01.053
I have lost sight of them.

02:31:31.035 --> 02:31:34.045
They are fighting!

02:31:58.047 --> 02:31:59.049
Now!

02:32:29.043 --> 02:32:30.045
Be careful!

02:32:52.049 --> 02:32:56.027
Prepare your weapons! Fire!

02:33:20.055 --> 02:33:23.019
To port!

02:33:27.023 --> 02:33:29.039
- Salt!
- Careful!

02:34:02.049 --> 02:34:05.045
- Great, Jake!
- Brother, look.

02:34:33.047 --> 02:34:35.039
Jake!

02:34:38.057 --> 02:34:40.061
It's the People of Ash.

02:34:40.065 --> 02:34:44.023
Furious riders.
More than a hundred.

02:34:44.027 --> 02:34:47.037
These are our allies.
They have IFF labels.

02:34:47.041 --> 02:34:51.041
Now that Sully is out of
danger, I'll take care of the rest.

02:35:27.049 --> 02:35:30.045
They can't win.

02:35:30.049 --> 02:35:32.065
They kill them.

02:35:33.059 --> 02:35:35.021
Kiri!

02:35:36.059 --> 02:35:39.045
- Stop her!
- Kiri, stop.

02:35:39.049 --> 02:35:42.055
Comes back. You're
in danger out here.

02:35:42.059 --> 02:35:48.035
—I must invoke the Great Mother.
—Not underwater. Then you will die.

02:35:54.033 --> 02:35:56.019
Kiri, stop!

02:35:56.045 --> 02:35:59.021
-Kiri!
-Kiri!

02:35:59.025 --> 02:36:00.049
Come!

02:36:01.059 --> 02:36:05.025
Piss too. Tuk, stay here.

02:36:05.029 --> 02:36:07.049
Lo'ak, come on.

02:36:07.053 --> 02:36:10.035
You shouldn't follow me.

02:36:39.358 --> 02:36:41.372
-They are coming.
- Fight with us.

02:36:42.370 --> 02:36:44.368
We must defend mothers.

02:36:44.372 --> 02:36:47.374
- I'll stay with her.
- Come on!

02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:06.382
Almoder, listen to my
words. You must help us.

02:37:08.378 --> 02:37:12.380
I beg you. You
are our only hope.

02:37:25.396 --> 02:37:28.382
We need you.

02:37:30.362 --> 02:37:32.364
You shouldn't reject me.

02:37:36.372 --> 02:37:40.386
I beg you. No,
please, don't do it.

02:37:48.356 --> 02:37:50.384
No, no, no...

02:37:52.376 --> 02:37:55.376
- Monkey!
- Now we do it.

02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:57.368
Come on!

02:37:59.352 --> 02:38:00.382
Come!

02:38:00.386 --> 02:38:02.352
Boy!

02:38:18.356 --> 02:38:21.354
I beg you!

02:38:24.366 --> 02:38:27.394
Help us! People are dying!

02:38:36.354 --> 02:38:38.360
No!

02:38:40.358 --> 02:38:42.368
- Play!
- Come on!

02:38:42.372 --> 02:38:45.390
Come on! We can do it!

02:38:48.364 --> 02:38:50.368
Sully never gives up.

02:39:07.376 --> 02:39:11.356
- Come on!
- Come on!

02:39:29.392 --> 02:39:33.364
Grandma, help us.

02:39:34.370 --> 02:39:36.370
People are dying.

02:39:38.376 --> 02:39:43.364
I call upon the Warrior Mother.  You are our only hope.

02:40:42.392 --> 02:40:44.372
Boy!

02:40:59.364 --> 02:41:00.384
After him.

02:41:06.370 --> 02:41:07.396
Lock him up.

02:41:38.366 --> 02:41:43.356
Saata, talented girl.

02:41:58.378 --> 02:42:00.390
- Are you OK?  - Yeah.

02:42:01.376 --> 02:42:02.398
Where is Kiri?

02:42:07.378 --> 02:42:10.362
Jake, I've been knocked down.

02:42:11.354 --> 02:42:14.352
Hurry up and get to safety.  Don't attack.

02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:18.392
It's over with us.

02:42:21.356 --> 02:42:22.396
No …

02:42:36.396 --> 02:42:40.354
- Dad!  - Look...

02:42:41.362 --> 02:42:43.392
Don't worry, I've got you covered.

02:42:50.386 --> 02:42:52.374
Tsahik!

02:43:04.378 --> 02:43:08.376
- Stay here.  I will save her.  - Don't leave me.

02:43:18.358 --> 02:43:19.366
Sa'ata, wait.

02:43:24.374 --> 02:43:27.376
- I'm dying.  - No, you're not.

02:43:28.368 --> 02:43:31.398
Why do you always have to be on the other side?

02:43:32.354 --> 02:43:36.386
I'm going to die, but first I'll push the baby out.

02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:46.378
How much pressure!

02:43:48.386 --> 02:43:50.388
I got you.

02:43:55.396 --> 02:44:01.378
—I'll get it out of you in three.  —No, wait.  The wound must be bandaged.

02:44:15.356 --> 02:44:16.396
Kiri!  Kiri!

02:44:17.386 --> 02:44:19.352
Kiri!

02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:28.384
Are you OK?

02:44:29.396 --> 02:44:32.396
- Alright.  - Good.

02:44:33.372 --> 02:44:34.384
Push!

02:44:38.370 --> 02:44:41.356
One more push.

02:44:42.384 --> 02:44:45.396
She's coming now.

02:44:49.380 --> 02:44:51.360
Take your son.

02:44:57.364 --> 02:45:00.398
Thank you, Neytiri.

02:45:01.384 --> 02:45:03.380
Thank you.

02:45:07.358 --> 02:45:10.362
What should your name be?

02:45:10.366 --> 02:45:13.392
His name will be Pril.

02:45:15.382 --> 02:45:17.388
be strong

02:45:21.394 --> 02:45:25.364
Pril is a good name.

02:45:25.368 --> 02:45:28.398
Will you protect her?

02:45:29.354 --> 02:45:30.378
Yeah.

02:45:52.394 --> 02:45:55.382
Sorry, I left my post.

02:45:55.386 --> 02:46:00.372
It's okay, boy.  You have proven your worth.

02:46:01.382 --> 02:46:04.388
You made the Tulkuns fight.

02:46:05.390 --> 02:46:09.360
Toruk Makto couldn't do it, but you can.

02:46:10.386 --> 02:46:12.382
I'm proud of you.

02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:46.364
Alright, guys.

02:46:46.368 --> 02:46:50.352
Now we are working together.  Work calls.

02:46:50.356 --> 02:46:51.388
Oh really?

02:46:53.388 --> 02:46:58.372
There are 100 billion dollars waiting for us in that cove.

02:47:00.370 --> 02:47:02.364
I give beer.

02:47:03.392 --> 02:47:07.352
Your name is Pril.

02:47:07.356 --> 02:47:10.358
Your mother was strong
and you will be too.

02:47:10.362 --> 02:47:12.368
Mrs. Sully.

02:47:31.354 --> 02:47:32.370
Booty of war.

02:47:33.382 --> 02:47:36.374
Dad. Dad, look.

02:47:47.384 --> 02:47:51.386
I need you now. At my side.

02:47:51.390 --> 02:47:55.362
- I need my partner.
- Alright.

02:47:55.366 --> 02:47:57.372
Departure.

02:48:09.378 --> 02:48:13.354
Jake, I know you're out
there. I know you can hear me.

02:48:14.376 --> 02:48:17.360
Varang is being hard on your wife.

02:48:26.362 --> 02:48:30.358
You must surrender
and take Spider with you.

02:48:30.362 --> 02:48:34.368
And I know you
received it. Thanks love.

02:48:40.378 --> 02:48:43.398
Picadores, let's go!

02:48:58.364 --> 02:49:01.370
- They're getting caught.
- Keep those heifers under control.

02:49:17.398 --> 02:49:21.390
- 100 meters.
- Put me in shooting range.

02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:31.362
Matadors, advancing
silently and firmly.

02:49:32.374 --> 02:49:35.362
Submarines, prepare torpedoes.

02:49:35.366 --> 02:49:38.378
- Arm torpedoes.
- Arms 1 to 4.

02:49:38.382 --> 02:49:41.372
- 60 meters.
- Target frame.

02:49:48.374 --> 02:49:50.362
Security.

02:49:52.390 --> 02:49:54.382
Ready to open fire.

02:50:06.148 --> 02:50:07.166
See!

02:50:22.148 --> 02:50:26.178
Stop the shooting. We
have a problem here.

02:50:27.164 --> 02:50:30.188
It's Eywa. It worked!

02:50:51.188 --> 02:50:54.172
- Careful!
- Get us out of here!

02:51:16.152 --> 02:51:18.150
Maximum power!

02:51:18.154 --> 02:51:21.166
All boats back to the ship!

02:51:23.176 --> 02:51:26.166
Take it, shiphead!

02:52:24.146 --> 02:52:26.186
- Saquennos de aquí.
- The engine is dead.

02:53:25.178 --> 02:53:27.188
¡Reinícialo!

02:53:29.174 --> 02:53:32.160
Madam General, the
flow is dragging us.

02:53:35.148 --> 02:53:38.178
- Abandon the ship.
- Abandon ship!

02:53:44.168 --> 02:53:46.144
Stay close to me.

02:53:56.168 --> 02:53:58.162
Stay close to me.

02:53:59.190 --> 02:54:01.150
Free lane.

02:54:02.158 --> 02:54:03.180
Free lane.

02:54:08.180 --> 02:54:10.150
Below!

02:54:10.154 --> 02:54:13.160
To the lifeboats! Run!

02:54:17.178 --> 02:54:20.184
I'm going to need covering fire.

02:54:20.188 --> 02:54:25.152
I go to the left
and behind them.

02:54:25.156 --> 02:54:30.168
Just keep an eye on me. And
don't shoot anyone you love.

02:54:30.172 --> 02:54:32.146
Here we go.

02:54:43.184 --> 02:54:49.144
Colonel, this is Spider.
You shouldn't kill him.

02:54:51.168 --> 02:54:54.178
Where are you? Approach freely.

02:54:56.158 --> 02:54:58.178
Okay, I'm going out.

02:55:10.174 --> 02:55:15.152
Spider, do you hear
me? Se acaba el tiempo.

02:55:29.166 --> 02:55:31.166
Tsahik!

02:55:39.158 --> 02:55:41.174
I want to make an exchange.

02:55:41.178 --> 02:55:45.150
-Me against them.-It can be fixed.

02:55:46.156 --> 02:55:49.162
Come with me.  I keep my word.

02:55:49.166 --> 02:55:54.170
We can resolve the matter here and now, and then everyone can return home.

02:56:03.144 --> 02:56:06.172
Come on, let's go.

02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:29.184
Hit!

02:56:34.174 --> 02:56:36.170
Come on, Tuk!

02:56:51.150 --> 02:56:53.184
Leave my mother alone.

02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:02.146
Your pig!

02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:31.182
Find your mother and get her off the ship!

02:57:47.186 --> 02:57:50.146
Wait, boy.

02:58:07.148 --> 02:58:10.180
- Spider, here!  - Spider!

02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:24.186
-Jake!  - Spider!

02:58:36.170 --> 02:58:38.174
Fly, fly!

02:59:14.168 --> 02:59:16.172
Jake!

02:59:35.164 --> 02:59:38.164
I will kill you!

02:59:38.168 --> 02:59:41.172
Do you want to kill your own father?

02:59:41.176 --> 02:59:44.148
Don't tempt me

02:59:46.156 --> 02:59:47.178
Give it to me.

02:59:50.178 --> 02:59:53.158
You little brat!

02:59:55.174 --> 02:59:56.190
Come on, Jake.

02:59:58.162 --> 03:00:01.166
Hurry up, go.

03:01:36.182 --> 03:01:38.174
Jake!  Jake!

03:01:45.166 --> 03:01:47.172
My child!

03:01:48.178 --> 03:01:50.170
Spider!

03:01:53.146 --> 03:01:56.152
Pick it up here!

03:01:59.182 --> 03:02:02.164
- Get me up!  - Come on!

03:02:04.174 --> 03:02:07.160
If you hadn't shot me in the arm...

03:02:09.176 --> 03:02:15.144
- I should drop you.  - Then do it, dad.

03:02:15.178 --> 03:02:20.152
You're a piece of shit.  Lift us up.

03:02:44.146 --> 03:02:45.168
Take my hand.

03:02:52.166 --> 03:02:55.144
-Jake!  - Come on!

03:02:56.162 --> 03:02:59.164
We have you.  We have you.

03:03:15.144 --> 03:03:18.144
This is uncomfortable.

03:03:23.178 --> 03:03:28.174
And now what? Shall
we hold hands and sing?

03:03:29.184 --> 03:03:31.184
Should I learn to see?

03:03:33.190 --> 03:03:37.144
You have the choice.

03:03:46.174 --> 03:03:49.150
Wait! Wait!

03:03:49.154 --> 03:03:51.186
Wait, wait, wait.

03:03:58.148 --> 03:04:00.184
That's a really badass guy.

03:04:25.176 --> 03:04:27.156
Father…

03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:30.146
-Ma Jake, sit down.
-Come here.

03:04:46.158 --> 03:04:48.186
The light always returns.

03:05:00.068 --> 03:05:03.082
We are all connected
to the Great Mother...

03:05:05.062 --> 03:05:08.074
...who loves all his children.

03:05:12.084 --> 03:05:16.080
New life maintains energy…

03:05:17.082 --> 03:05:20.066
...like the breath of the world.

03:05:22.082 --> 03:05:28.086
My brother's voice was heard and
he was incorporated into the clan.

03:05:42.076 --> 03:05:47.086
In the spiritual world, we invoke
the strength of our ancestors…

03:05:49.072 --> 03:05:52.088
...of all those who have
walked the path before us.

03:06:03.102 --> 03:06:05.098
Come on, monkey.

03:06:15.062 --> 03:06:17.106
Off. Off.

03:06:26.082 --> 03:06:27.094
Thank you.

03:06:29.066 --> 03:06:31.102
- I see you.
- I see you.

03:06:31.106 --> 03:06:32.106
Bridge!

03:06:34.086 --> 03:06:39.082
You skxawng. I'm glad
to see you, little brother.

03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:44.084
Mom, it's Spider.

03:06:44.088 --> 03:06:49.064
I've heard a lot about you.
You are a troublemaker.

03:06:51.104 --> 03:06:55.072
You are alive for the first time, - -

03:06:55.076 --> 03:07:01.086
and your spirit will live in Eywa forever.

03:07:02.068 --> 03:07:05.086
You are one of us now.

03:07:05.090 --> 03:07:09.074
You are part of the people.

03:07:09.078 --> 03:07:10.106
The fattest.
