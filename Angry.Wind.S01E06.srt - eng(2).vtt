WEBVTT

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
Easy, easy

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.280
Ow, ow, ow

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.160
Bear it a bit

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
I'll do it myself

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.400
Don't move

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.600
This little injury is nothing

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.120
For those two sisters

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.760
You'll even risk your life, huh?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.200
Mainly to defeat Xie Jiachang

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.280
What's second then?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.560
Serves you right to hurt like hell

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.160
Hey, I almost got beaten to death

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.360
No one even cared about me

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.760
You two are still there...

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.760
Ah!

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.920
Brother Feng, hurry out

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.960
Outside is packed; they're all here for you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.200
A Qiang

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.400
I'm badly hurt too

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.160
Could you wipe me down too?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.080
Okay, okay, come here

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.200
I'll wipe it for you properly

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.680
Ow, ow, it hurts, hurts, hurts!

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.720
Mr. Zheng, please take care of us

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.560
Here's my business card

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.200
Enjoy yourselves, have some drinks

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.120
Thank you, Mr. Zheng

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.600
Ms. Zhou

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.920
Is this Manager Zheng?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.400
Mm

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.000
As expected, a promising young talent

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.400
We must definitely work together

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.880
Absolutely, absolutely

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.400
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Zheng

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.720
Hey, hey

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.360
Ah!

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.080
Sister Zhiyi

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.080
It's just over half an hour

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.040
We're already on the 13th wave of people

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.280
Doing toasts and handing cards

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.880
Is Brother Feng raising his banner?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.480
Raise a banner, my ass

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.280
You think he's a gangster legend?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.800
He got truly famous from that dance hall fight

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.320
Remember the night Xie Jiachang's club closed

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.560
What did Master Qin say?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.120
One word from Master Qin makes a huge stir

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.400
What's his background, anyway?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.200
How do you think he became

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.800
the president of the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.520
He's nicknamed the Land King of Haicheng

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.400
In Haicheng, no one dares contradict him

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.800
More importantly, he reads people perfectly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.520
But saying stuff like 'change Haicheng's fate'

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.200
He was the first

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.600
Then he really misjudged, huh

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.360
I don't care at all

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.720
Then what do you care about?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.120
Xie Jiachang is already in prison

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.200
The only thing I care about now

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.320
is to live peacefully with you

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.560
for the rest of my life

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.480
Boss Zheng

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.480
Come down for a drink

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.760
I can't handle it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.560
Can you cover me for a bit?

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.320
Uh...

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.800
I'm going to the restroom

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.080
I can't cover

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.520
My injury isn't healed

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.600
Mm

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.720
A business card, right?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.000
I can't take it right now

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.800
Just put it there

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.120
Our boss would like to invite you for tea

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.560
Please come with us

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.200
Huh?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.200
So it's not a business card

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.360
Okay

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.680
I'll come over myself later

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.000
Master Qin

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.000
How come you don't recognize me?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400
You made quite a show inviting me over

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.400
If I hadn't seen you

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.720
I'd have thought I was kidnapped

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.960
Didn't I tell you to invite him over?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.920
Isn't this how we always do it?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.200
Go down

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.680
My men were a bit rash

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.560
Please don't take offense

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.400
Come, sit, sit, sit

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.800
In your early twenties

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.400
No people

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.680
No money

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.480
In less than a month

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.920
you brought down Xie Jiachang's dance hall

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.880
The young are formidable

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.320
Master Qin, you flatter me

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.120
Just luck

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.680
You don't need to be modest

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.160
Young people are full of fire

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.200
You should have some drive

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.000
And a bit of pride

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.960
Master Qin, you called me here today

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.800
Is there something you want to advise me on?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.760
Then I'll keep it brief

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.360
Please, go ahead

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.320
You have ability

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.560
Brave and resourceful

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.920
I have high hopes for you

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.520
So I want to bring you

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.360
to do bigger business

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.520
Business

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.720
What business?

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.360
Do you know, in Haicheng,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.760
I have a title?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.680
You are the Land King of Haicheng

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.800
You aren't trying to rope me into real estate, are you?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.360
Yes

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.280
To do real estate

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.880
You have ability

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.160
Brave and resourceful

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.160
So partnering with you

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.880
puts me at ease

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.480
Master Qin

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.400
You actually want to use me

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.480
to counterbalance the forces in Haicheng, right?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.000
You're very smart

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.280
As the chairman of the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.800
I must balance relations in Haicheng's business world

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.160
I can't let one group dominate

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.960
Master Qin

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.040
I forgot to tell you something

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.520
I'm with Zhou Zhiyi now

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.280
Oh, that's great

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.360
Xie Jiachang is already in jail

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.200
I just want to live a good life with Zhou Zhiyi now

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.360
Maybe we should just call this off

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.320
Master Qin

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.720
Xie Rong

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.600
Long time no see

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.280
How's your health?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.800
Pretty good, pretty good

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.600
Have a seat

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.440
Let me introduce you

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.520
This is...

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.840
the general manager of the New Literati Club, Zheng Nanfeng

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.920
And this is...

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.920
is Xie Jiachang's biological older sister

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.760
Xie Rong

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.480
She has been doing business overseas for years

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.600
What, are you surprised?

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.320
I heard a real talent has emerged in Haicheng

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.680
In less than a month

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.680
and wrecked my brother's dance hall

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.400
and even sent him to prison

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.600
Oh

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.920
He brought that on himself

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.080
You're not here to seek revenge on me, are you?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.040
My little brother...

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.680
was spoiled by us since childhood

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.280
He does behave rather wildly

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
He lost to you

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.200
because his skills were inferior

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.080
He has no one else to blame

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.680
Master Qin, I heard you're getting into real estate

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.160
I came back this time to work with you

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.600
Sure

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.960
As long as you have the talent and ability,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.040
my door for cooperation is always open

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.680
By the way, I'd like to compete with GM Zheng

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.560
Oh

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.760
Don't overthink it

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.640
It has nothing to do with revenge

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.280
I'm just simply curious about you

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.240
Mm

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.840
I've already told Master Qin

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.840
I'm not interested in real estate; I won't take part

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.640
Ah

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.040
That's a pity

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.880
A pity to lose such a good opponent

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.760
But if you won't spar

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.880
I'll have to make my move at Zhou Zhiyi

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.960
See if she's interested

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.280
Zhou Zhiyi is my wife

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.360
If you dare go after her,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.480
I don't care whether you're a woman or not,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.360
I'm talking about business

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.560
Why are you getting worked up?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.720
Master Qin

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.800
There are four areas in Haicheng awaiting development now

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.440
The best is Dongyang Xincun

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.600
It's close to the hospital and school

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.480
It's a sure-profit piece of land

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.000
The worst is Xiliu Tang

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.040
Demolition costs are high in the old city

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.480
The location is also poor

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.560
It has already scared off four waves of big firms

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:39.880
Near Dongyang Xincun,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.840
a mysterious investor has appeared lately

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.880
Moves fast, precise, and ruthless

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.960
If I'm not mistaken,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.880
it's you, right?

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.840
Master Qin

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.960
Since we're already rivals,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.440
then I have to spar with Ms. Xie here

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.440
Good

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.560
Competition brings motivation

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.680
As it happens, I have a problem over at Dongyang Xincun

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.400
A few holdout households aren't resolved in demolition

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.640
Which of you can handle him?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.440
the Dongyang Xincun plot goes to whoever does

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.360
Are you sure you want to go in?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.680
I can't even afford underwear in this shop.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.280
This is the priciest store in all Haicheng.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.920
We’re about to switch camps.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.280
There’s a tough battle to fight.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.800
Before that, let’s spruce ourselves up.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.840
Brother Feng has already spoken.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.200
What are you dawdling for? Get in.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.680
Hey, do we need to wear a tie to go in?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.880
Are you guys wearing ties?

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.600
Sir, you can only try if you’re going to buy.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.640
I’m here to buy clothes.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.160
Our suits start at 1,999 yuan each.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.280
So cheap.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.440
We don’t buy ones that cheap.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.680
Oh my, listen to you.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.760
I didn’t mean that.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.640
Which one caught your eye?

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.440
I’ll get it for you.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.280
Today it’s on me, pick whatever you like.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.800
Brother Feng.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.760
You said it.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.880
Then I won’t hold back.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.200
Assistant.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.640
Bring out all the smallest sizes, I’ll try them all.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.440
Okay, okay.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.360
Wrap them all up.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.080
Scan the code.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.000
Sir.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.880
Scan what code?

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.880
No.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.720
I forgot this era has no codes.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.680
Um, uh.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.400
Brother Feng.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.080
Don’t tell me you didn’t bring money.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.480
Ha, you guessed right.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.640
How about this, you two pay first.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.560
I’ll pay you back later.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.600
See, I told you.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.200
He can’t even afford underwear here, and you doubted me.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.360
How much is it in total?

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.880
9,400.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.280
Pay up.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.280
Pay up.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.120
I...

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.480
Socks, socks.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.840
This is all I’ve got.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.800
A total of 164 yuan and 3 jiao.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.880
You lot.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.640
I knew you were off the moment you walked in.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.080
No money, yet you pretend to be big shots?

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.000
We’re not broke.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.640
We just didn’t bring it.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.200
Ah.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200
Alright then, leave the clothes here.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.240
I’ll go back and get the money.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.400
We’ll come back later to pick them up.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.840
Are you just here to mess with me?

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.040
If you don’t have money, don’t try them.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.480
These are brand-name clothes.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.880
You keep lifting and handling them.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.480
If they get dirty, how do we sell them?

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.040
Hey, how can you talk like that?

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.360
Are your clothes so precious?

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.280
They get dirty from just trying?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.160
You’re trying to scam us, right?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.400
Hey, how can you be so uncivil?

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.480
The poorer you are, the more shameless.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.600
Hey!

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.880
He called me shameless!

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.480
Who has no manners?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.400
I’ll show you what no manners looks like.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.200
Do you want to see?

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.200
Hey, hey, sorry, sorry.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.200
Sorry about that.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.080
No, no.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.600
This won’t do, this won’t do.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.200
Yo.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.240
Sis, you’re here.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.640
It’s quite lively today.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.280
Sis, let’s stay away from those poor wretches.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.200
They try but can’t afford it, honestly.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.560
Ah.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.280
Mm, yes.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.560
The one in front really...

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.880
looks sneaky and shifty.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.080
If you’re going to talk, just talk.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.240
Why make it personal?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.880
You should just hurry up and leave.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.080
Don’t be an eyesore to my sis.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.680
It’s fine.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.600
We’ll do our own shopping.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.200
Come, sis, over here.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.200
Nanfeng

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.360
What's Zhiyi trying to do?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.560
Don't rush

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.000
Let's see what she plans to do

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.680
Sis, you look great in all of these

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.240
Alright, I'll buy these today

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.000
Alright

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.400
Please get your manager over here

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.960
I'm buying a lot today

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960
Ask him to give me a discount

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.760
Alright

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.560
Ma'am, we'll give you five percent off

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.880
Thank you

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.360
Please wrap these and those up

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.480
Ma'am, these are those beggars' clothes

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.640
Please don't take the wrong ones

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.480
Why are you all still not leaving?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.920
Do you have to wait till I call the police?

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.080
I didn't take the wrong ones

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.200
They're all mine

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.400
Why are you standing there? Go

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.200
Oh, okay

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.000
Darling, remember to bring your wallet when you go out

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.040
Oh, my brother-in-law picked it

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.440
I knew it

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.080
Such good taste, haha

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.280
Hey, who just said he was a stinking beggar?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.480
How come now he has good taste?

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.280
Brother, I did not recognize your greatness

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.880
Please don't blame your little sister

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080
Okay, enough

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.200
Ring it up

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.680
Alright

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680
All packed

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.440
After five percent off

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.880
The total is 16,500

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.520
Buying so much at once, and the priciest too

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.680
My commission this month will top 1,000

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.960
No need for a discount

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.400
Ma'am

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.360
The manager already said

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.480
We can give five percent off

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.640
I said no need

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.560
But I have one request

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.920
Please go ahead, ma'am

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.080
Fire her

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.840
Ma'am, you must be joking, right?

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.880
You sell in a high-end place like this

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.440
You must get a lot of commission

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.840
But someone like you who snubs the poor and fawns over the rich

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.640
Does not deserve to earn my money

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.880
You think you can fire me just like that?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.880
Manager, I think she is just here to cause trouble

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.680
Shut up

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.600
Xiao Xian

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.760
Lately I have received many

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.680
Complaints that you snub the poor and fawn over the rich

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.560
Our store does not need someone like you

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.240
Starting tomorrow, do not come to work

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.760
Ma'am, are you satisfied with this?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.280
Wrap them up and let's go

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.800
Wow, you guys have totally changed

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.600
What will the company be called from now on?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.480
From now on we are Yida Real Estate

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.000
I miss you

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.920
Whenever dusk arrives

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.800
The evening breeze rises

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.640
Miss you

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.640
The riddle of life

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.760
Try not to see it clearly

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.160
Close your eyes

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.360
Do not respond

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.360
Night wind blows and blows

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.040
Go with the wind

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.480
Tonight, children, do not cry in secret

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.640
Do not cry in secret

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.480
Night wind blows and blows

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.160
Go with the wind

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.320
With nightfall and stars

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.320
Gently fall asleep

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.760
Let the evening wind blow
