=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

(It's Hard to Tell Who's A Better Actor)

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.562
(The Next Day)

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.680
Miss. Have you received news
from Magistrate Lu?

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.040
Where shall we go now?

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:29.680
Find someone for me.

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:31.440
I'll handle the rest.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.239
Alright.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.600
Why did you coerce me

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.320
to come here?

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.639
Why did your servant boy

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.320
overturn my boat in the water

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.360
a few days ago?

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.119
What are you saying?

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.240
I don't understand.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.119
You understand.

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.279
Your series of schemes
were quite clever,

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.919
but you picked the wrong person.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.240
You never should've

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.800
pin it on me.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.479
It seems you insist

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.160
I explain everything one by one.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.919
Very well.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.399
Let's start from the beginning.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.279
The day I fell in the water,

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.639
the weather was perfect.

00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:47.606
There's not a single breeze.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.360
If there was no wind,

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.440
could my boat have been alive

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.800
to flip on its own?

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.119
Since Fan Jili is dead,

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.320
why did someone see him in the streets?

00:02:58.919 --> 00:02:59.919
And whose charred corpse

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.240
was that?

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.679
Your imagination

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.080
is vivid.

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.960
Why would I do such a thing?

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:09.119
Good question.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.039
It was

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.039
to use me as a witness.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.679
First, you subdued Fan Jili,

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.199
then found a corpse
to burn as a stand-in.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.960
The next day, you staged my fall

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.679
and rescued me.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.759
Then you place Fan Jili in a carriage,

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:29.720
(Fan)
parading him through the city

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.119
so that everyone would see.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.880
In this way,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.080
Fan Jili died in the afternoon,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.119
and you couldn't have traveled
to the western suburbs.

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.240
Suspicion against you
is naturally cleared.

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.850
What if the corpse
had been found earlier?

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.320
That place is deserted.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.839
Only a woodsman passes the abandoned
house every noon without fail.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.279
You must have

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.199
investigated it.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.559
It's all calculated.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.279
How about this?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.399
I'll count to three.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.039
If you can't convince me,

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:00.479
I will have you prosecuted.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.600
County Magistrate Jiang.

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.160
Magistrate Lu is in that teahouse.

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.880
He must covet my lady's beauty

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.160
and intends to commit a crime.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.479
Three.

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:09.639
You have no proof.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.880
If I examine the corpse,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.399
determine their age,
gender, and burial duration...

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:15.080
Two.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.600
Instead of arresting directly,
you act secretly.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.200
You must be up to something.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.239
What do you want?

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.760
Just speak plainly.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.320
Great.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.679
Here's the deal.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.920
I want you

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.760
to take those pretending boys

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.880
and leave Huachang County.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.279
You...

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.200
Toad venom aroma

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.399
takes effect
in about a quarter of an hour.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.160
Sir.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:49.799
You don't think

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:51.679
I enjoy listening to all this nonsense,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.359
do you?

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:59.160
This is news I just bought
from a broker in the capital.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.279
A top scholar.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.990
Accomplished
in both civil and martial arts.

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:05.320
Wrote poems and painted at Tunhai House.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.640
Famous in the capital.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.600
Praised by influential officials.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.079
You were sent
to a small county like ours.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.679
You're likely to rise quickly.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.239
A person so skilled
in currying favor and avoiding harm

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.239
cannot truly be a fool.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.760
If I don't take precautions,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.000
then

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.160
you'd be a fool.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.359
(Whether for the people
of Huachang County)

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.000
(or the prophecy of that day,)

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.119
(such scum and disaster)

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:35.920
(cannot be allowed to remain.)

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:37.200
Wait.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.279
You cannot kill me.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.679
I'll count to three.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.399
If you cannot convince me,

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.519
I will act on you first.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.399
Your fake corpse is in my hands.

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:49.839
(If you kill me,)

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.760
(the fake corpse matter
will be exposed.)

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.359
(Someone will then trace
Fan Jili's whereabouts.)

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.600
(Your plan)

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.920
(will probably fail.)

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:00.959
This item is called Don't Defy.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.990
When it acts up,
you'll be in heart-wrenching pain.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.190
Within these 12 days,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.000
I must be able to freely
enter and exit the magistrate's office.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:11.079
No matter what method you use.

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:13.320
Magistrate Lu.

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:14.320
Are you inside?

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.559
Sir.

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:17.600
What are you doing?

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.760
Don't come any closer.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.790
Prepare a carriage.

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.720
Sir.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.640
Fan Jili from Huachang County

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.880
seems to have suddenly died.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040
How did he die?

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.200
I heard he was burned alive.

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:42.440
Noted.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.480
There's another matter.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.559
Speak.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.720
The one surnamed Lu from the capital

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.190
has taken office in Huachang County.

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:52.440
Keep a close eye on him.

00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:53.760
Yes.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.987
(Huachang County Magistrate Office)

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.600
(Huachang County Magistrate Office)
I disturbed you.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.959
My apologies.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.820
County Magistrate Jiang.

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:12.760
It's this room.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.590
Cooperate if you don't want to die.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.839
Sir.

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:19.959
What are you doing?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.839
My lady is born weak.

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:31.200
(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)
No need to trouble Master Jiang.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.720
Are you alright?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.640
Miss.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.959
Have Huiyi guard the carriage.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.359
Fan Jili was inside.

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:53.160
If someone inspects carefully,

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.559
they might discover something.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:55.320
Yes.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.160
You...

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.679
Don't worry.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.279
He's not capable enough.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.959
(Jiang Chun.)

00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:14.040
(What exactly is your link
to the Thrush Case?)

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.080
You reacted well just now.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.440
Doesn't it fit

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.840
your lecherous reputation perfectly?

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:43.599
I've cooperated as much as I can.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.500
You've entered
the county magistrate office too.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:46.880
What's your next move?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.599
(This person is trouble anyway.)

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.400
(He should be dealt with sooner)

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:52.719
(to prevent future problems.)

00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:56.520
Now,

00:08:57.239 --> 00:08:58.599
help me find someone immediately.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.840
You have the nerve to give orders.

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:07.000
Who?

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:10.880
Jiang Chun.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.479
This is

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:30.880
a bamboo comb.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.919
How do I use it?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.119
You've never seen one?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.520
I thought young ladies
would all have one or two.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:41.119
Is that so strange?

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:46.200
I've never used one.

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:48.039
Do I use it like this?

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.280
What you want has arrived.

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:23.280
Ms. Li.

00:10:27.479 --> 00:10:28.320
Please come in.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.080
I heard some noise when I was outside

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:02.640
and knew you've woken up.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.520
That day at Xuezhao Residence,

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.280
you faked spirits to swindle people.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:08.840
I won't take back

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.359
calling you a demoness.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.960
However,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320
what just happened

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:17.679
wasn't your fault.

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:19.479
I didn't expect Lu

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:21.200
to bully in broad daylight.

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:23.960
He's the local official here.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.260
You might find it hard
to stand your ground here after this.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.919
If you want to escape his harassment,

00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:29.359
I have some money.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:30.440
Take it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.380
Leave Huachang County immediately.

00:11:36.719 --> 00:11:37.880
If I must leave,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.559
I can stand anywhere.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.239
But I have things I must do.

00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:44.479
I cannot leave.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.840
Thank you for your guidance.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.840
Can you speak a bit closer?
