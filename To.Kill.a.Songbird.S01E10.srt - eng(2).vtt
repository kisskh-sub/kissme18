=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

=Episode 10=
(to Expose the Guilty)

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.120
You know who she really is.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.519
It was your husband, Zhao Chengxi,

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:22.839
who led you here to kill her.

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.199
What if your husband deceived you?

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:28.199
My husband would never lie to me.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.839
Back then, I was struck by the epidemic

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.120
and confined to my bed.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.879
He stayed by my side without rest,

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.519
caring for me day and night.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.639
How could he ever deceive me?

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.959
Li Ji killed the one I loved most.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.080
That is the truth.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.879
He would never lie to me!

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:51.519
The Li family deserved their fate.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.919
His brother murdered my husband.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.720
My two children died in the epidemic.

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:01.440
How is my Shen family any different
from being wiped out entirely?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.800
You said it to my face

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.399
that you hated her,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.720
hated her for being a murderer's sister.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.360
You said you would abandon her,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.919
leave her to die alone and miserable.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.639
Whether I said those words or not,

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.360
you never intended
to let me leave alive.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.600
Since death was inevitable,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.080
I chose not to say them.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:30.399
- You...
- Shang Jin.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.440
Do not let them deceive you
and turn you into a pawn.

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.600
Interesting.

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:45.800
How easy it would be to say
a few gentle words.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.119
Why would you not do it?

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.880
Why did you refuse so stubbornly?

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.119
Because she is nothing like
what you imagine her to be.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.720
Even when she was framed and wronged,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.919
she still risked her life

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.199
to seek the truth.

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.399
Even when she

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.960
was adrift like floating weeds,

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.080
with her family destroyed
and nothing to rely on,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.759
she was still willing
to take in another's child.

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.600
She is someone

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.880
people like you,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.000
who blur right and wrong
for personal revenge,

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.440
will never be able to understand.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.199
He is dead. Now it is your turn.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.960
Who lives and who dies

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.919
is not for you to decide.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.839
Fine. Then we die together.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.119
It has gone quiet.

00:04:01.162 --> 00:04:04.175
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:06.362
(In Mourning)

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:18.600
You killed Shen Xiu,

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.839
framed another man,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.519
then took his wife for yourself.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.200
Now you incited Shang Jin to kill me,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600
to bury the past once and for all.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.239
Do you have proof?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.880
To lure us into your trap,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.399
you had Shang Jin place this object

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:37.399
(Ji)
beside Mo Feibai's cage,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.959
then coated it with a numbing poison.

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.040
The forged mark
on the severed head back then

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.959
(Ji)
was made using Li Ji's seal.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:48.150
(Ji)

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.799
Enough with these tricks.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.100
Shen Xiu was nothing more than a servant
who raised birds for me.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.480
And he dared to compete with me
for the woman I loved.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.239
So what if I killed him?

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:06.640
Since you are here,
do not expect to leave alive.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:08.239
You included.

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:13.320
So you finally admit it.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.320
Dear.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.519
Thirteen years ago,

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.839
you were the one who killed him.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.720
Dear.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.290
All these years, I treated you...

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.359
You respected me and cared for me.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.480
You granted every request I ever made.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.490
And just because of that,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.480
you thought I would believe
everything you said

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.880
and kill someone for you?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.799
Do you not find that terribly naive?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.440
The invitations were sent long ago.

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.119
All these years,
I pretended to be mad and foolish,

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:46.200
waiting to see
when you would finally slip.

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:47.440
That was the safest way.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.359
Played along with my act.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.959
In my view,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.519
hesitating at every step
only lets others control you.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.799
A sudden move may be the only way
to break through.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.760
And how do you plan to do that?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.000
Shang Jin,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.160
do not let villains deceive and use you.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.359
Sir, there are ears beyond the wall.

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:12.720
Play along with me.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:17.720
He is dead. Now it is your turn.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.279
You probably never realized

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.880
that the one you loved
has been poisoning you for years.

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:27.160
The toxins have built up in your body.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:28.799
You do not have long to live.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.200
This incense is called Lovesickness.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.880
It draws the mind into illusion,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.990
letting one see
the happiest moments of their life,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.440
lost in longing.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.270
After that,
there is no strength left to act.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.079
Zhao Chengxi, confess your crimes.

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:02.839
Jin,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.640
you have forgiven me,

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.480
haven't you?

00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:21.600
You think I forgot?

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.359
I was only waiting for you to die.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.640
No!

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.040
(The eighth year of Zhenghe,)

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.880
(The first day of the sixth month.)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.559
(Clear skies.)

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.799
(A breeze in the air.)

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.090
(Grudges and debts laid to rest.)

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:35.359
(Flowers broken and fallen.)

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:37.612
(Seven days remain
until the seventh of the sixth month)

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.600
You cannot die.

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:00.320
You must live

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.279
and speak the whole truth.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.679
Why?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.359
Why?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
If a murderer
was never judged back then,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.200
do you think time can make it right?

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:21.399
I trust no one but myself.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.440
Only by killing him with my own hands
can I face death without regret.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.959
Are you dead?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.600
Are you dead?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.919
You...

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.440
The day I saw Yexin and Huiyi,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.520
I knew at once

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.520
they were my children.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.760
A mother's instinct
is frightening, isn't it?

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.919
Thank you for watching over them for me.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.520
Huiyi.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.080
You have taken such good care of them.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.479
Their eyes are still clear and innocent.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.760
I do not have much time left.

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:03.239
There is one more thing.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:06.119
That Mo Feibai

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:07.840
is the very bird

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:09.960
Xiu raised back then.

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:11.520
After the murder,

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.640
it flew back on its own.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:16.719
I lied to Zhao Chengxi
and said I bought it at the bird market.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.679
Here, take my handkerchief.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.960
As long as you hold it,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.320
it will follow you.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.919
In this world, it is easy to die,
but hard to go on living.

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:31.119
I am about to take that shortcut myself.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.159
I hope you will keep walking
a little longer.

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:45.840
Let's get out first. Go.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.475
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.000
(Meeting stone in water.)

00:10:16.119 --> 00:10:18.039
(This person stands
in a place of power,)

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.919
(yet will still drag you down
into the mire.)

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.000
(Are you truly not afraid?)

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:25.599
(If the price of vengeance
is only one life,)

00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:28.440
(then I have already gained
more than enough.)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.880
(Why would fear still have a place?)

00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:37.612
(Born as a sparrow,
to perish upon striking stone)

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.239
To perish upon striking stone.

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:50.080
(Shi Lang is the trial fate
never meant me to escape.)

00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:51.679
(Yesterday you bound me)

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.159
(and made me miss the right moment.)

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:55.159
(I nearly died outside the city.)

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.359
(You tied me
and took me out of the city.)

00:10:56.359 --> 00:10:57.540
(I used you to reach the mountain.)

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.719
(That makes us even.)

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.880
(After we come down the mountain,)

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.720
(it is best that our paths
be kept separate.)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.690
(From then on,
we owe each other nothing.)
