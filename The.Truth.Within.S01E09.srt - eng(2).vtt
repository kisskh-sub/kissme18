00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.010
Fei!

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.650
Your father's gone.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.780
Now you're gone too.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.370
How am I supposed to go on living?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.330
What am I supposed to do?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.010
It's all your fault.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.410
All because you didn't
talk her out of it.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.770
You killed Fei!

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.300
It was you.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.410
Such a huge deal.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.900
Why not talk it over your mom?

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.650
If I'd told her,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.410
she would've never agreed.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.930
Our family already
has two police officers.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.850
You know

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.620
your dad's last wish.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.930
You do you, and I'll do me.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.290
I'm going into forensics.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.020
No way.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.540
I won't let you go.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.180
Feng.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.820
No.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.540
No way!

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.020
Young people

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.490
should have their own aspirations.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.210
Mom will understand eventually.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.410
She's right.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.490
The Yus are all blockheads.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.660
Feng!

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.540
You're part of the Yu family.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.050
Catch it!

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.820
Bye.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.540
The killer hid the body
among the specimens.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.410
The specimen room is
likely the primary scene.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.220
If the killer committed the murder here,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.370
then the wire fence in the back hills

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.220
could be where the killer escaped.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.730
Any sign of her head?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.100
Search is underway.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.410
Someone's cleaned this.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.250
Come on.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.610
Give it to me.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.130
Maybe the dismemberment took place here.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.490
Those two rooms were connected

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.980
and later left empty.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.100
So the left one became
the specimen room.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.010
We didn't know

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.820
someone was still using Lab 301.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.220
Mr. Huang must have

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.250
gotten a key when they
moved to the new building

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.250
and secretly kept using that lab.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.650
What's Mr. Huang's specialty?

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.490
Neurology.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.490
He's an old hand in anatomy,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.820
nicknamed One-Cut Huang.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.300
Mr. Huang...

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.730
Has he done anything

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.060
damaging to our reputation?

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.890
We're still investigating.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.770
His office.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:20.890
Mr. Huang?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.940
Mr. Huang?

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.610
No one's here.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.530
Could you open the door for us?

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.250
Oh, sure.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.420
Who are you?

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.250
Why are you in my office?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.060
Police.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.340
Not Liu Yuanyuan's head.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:32.650
And these

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.370
have been in formalin for a long time.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.580
Mr. Qi,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.700
Mr. Han and Ms. Zhu

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.060
are asking for the results.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.940
The victim's head hasn't been found.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.100
Any new findings

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.530
from the hills or the lab?

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.770
Not yet.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.250
But they brought someone in.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.980
Mr. Huang from Lab 301?

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:56.700
Yes.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.100
Where are they?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.490
Huang Zhengming,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.010
where were you

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.130
last Tuesday afternoon?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.010
What were you doing?

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.300
I don't recall.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.700
You don't recall? Then...

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.650
What about these?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.530
Since you've found them,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.890
I admit it.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.180
My mistake.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.100
He confessed? That fast?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.490
Then tell us

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.180
how you killed her.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.890
Killed?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.340
I have not killed anyone.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.180
And the dismemberment?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.100
These heads

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.940
were from donated cadavers.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.820
I've never seen this girl.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.010
I didn't kill anyone.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.650
I mean

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.300
I used university resources
for my experiments.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.610
I'll take my academic responsibility.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.060
Aer you saying

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.340
you just used donated remains?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.100
Then why are there extensive
signs of blood cleanup

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.220
from the specimen room to the lab?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.130
That's not my lab.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.940
The university halted my research.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.580
So I found an old lab

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.890
to continue my research.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.340
And that's it.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.180
You know what?

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.340
Brain dissection

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.820
is incredibly delicate and precise.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.770
How could there possibly be blood?

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.980
No way!

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.890
If a young woman's body

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.700
was dismembered

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.460
in your lab,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.650
would there be this much blood?

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.220
I don't know that girl.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.130
I didn't kill anyone!

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.770
Fine. Next question.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.940
How do you usually eat

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.180
at the office?

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.850
Whatever.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.890
Takeout, right?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.580
Yes.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.220
I scroll on my phone

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.850
and pick whatever I see.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.370
This shows the dates.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.460
From August 31st to September 15th,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.010
you kept

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.580
ordering from Spring Cuisine.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.730
They handle their own deliveries.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.850
No takeout riders.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.300
She's an employee there.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.530
After she went missing
on September 16th,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.850
you never ordered

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.300
from that restaurant again.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.820
How do you explain that?

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.100
Browsing on the phone is troublesome

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:11.580
and a waste of time.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.610
So I pick one restaurant
and stick with it.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.940
Is there an issue?

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.730
I always had the delivery person

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.130
leave it outside the door.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.580
I don't even know who delivered them.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.490
Mr. Huang,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.180
we know you're an expert in neurology,

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.850
specializing in cerebrospinal
fluid neuroanatomy

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.770
and gliomas.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.060
It takes

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.650
a lot of real dissection work

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.820
to back up any claim
about how neuroanatomy

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.650
relates to disease,

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.530
right?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.820
We've also learned

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.010
from your colleagues

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.370
that you've felt your
experiments were hindered.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.650
If you could do
extensive experimentation,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.650
you'd create medical wonders.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.850
These are all noted in your journals.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.530
You wanted to use
Liu Yuanyuan for a live experiment,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.770
but accidentally killed her,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.490
so you hid her head

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.220
and dumped the body

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.850
to mislead us, right?

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.530
Yes.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.850
For my research,

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.980
I am willing to kill.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.420
I've imagined countless times

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.580
about dissecting a human
brain to see its secrets.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.060
Even now,

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.820
looking at you two,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.180
I have an strong desire

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.850
to open your skulls.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.490
I'm a doctor.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.010
I need to find medication
to halt brain aging.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.980
For my research,

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.490
I'm willing to do anything.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:14.380
But,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.730
show me the evidence

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:16.770
that proves

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.380
I killed that girl!

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.330
We need to know where
that skull came from.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.730
Please cooperate fully.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.620
Mr. Qi, I'll go back first.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.010
Han Feng.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.420
I've seen Li Ming

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.700
wear this watch.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.490
And he

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.250
engraved this.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.620
Come on.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.140
Not everyone is
connected to Raw Diamond.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.620
Our most important task now

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.090
is to find who killed Liu Yuanyuan.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.980
Focus on your job.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.140
Han Feng!

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.420
Just do your job.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.090
Something's here!

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.140
Shovel.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.050
Open it.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.250
Found it.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.010
Huang's statement.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.810
Xi is verifying it.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.140
There are six skulls.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.330
Some were obtained by Huang
via his private contacts

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.490
at the donation center.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.860
Others were removed

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.530
from the discarded specimens.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.050
He didn't lie.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.250
Mr. Han, we've got something new.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.050
If the murder weapon is a hammer,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.090
the killer likely has
a medical background.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.330
Maybe someone from
the medical university.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.730
Was a similar hammer

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.940
found in Huang's office?

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.180
No.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.810
Time of death?

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.490
Based on the soil
moisture in the back hills,

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.900
air temperature,

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.250
her viscera,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.330
and the epidermis of the head,

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.090
the time of death should be

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.490
between 2 and 6 PM,

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.010
five days ago.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.490
Hey, Xi,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.940
now verify

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.730
Huang Zhengming's alibi.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.620
With the current evidence,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.730
I think

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.570
it's hard to identify
Huang Zhengming as the killer.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.140
We suspect Huang Zhengming

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.700
because we think he'd
use the victim's head

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.980
for neurological research.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.490
But aside from

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.810
the fatal blunt trauma
to the right parietal bone,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.420
the body shows no signs of dissection.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.050
In other words,

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.140
Huang Zhengming didn't
use Liu Yuanyuan's head

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.490
for brain research.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.050
Besides,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.570
this is

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.940
the donor list provided
by Huang Zhengming.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.010
And this is

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.220
the notebook found in Lab 301.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.570
The handwriting in the second half

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.330
closely matches the
handwriting on the list.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.140
But look at the handwriting
in the first half.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.730
It's completely different.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.660
Same writer?

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.570
Right.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.180
Both belong to

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.660
Huang Zhengming.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.050
The handwriting of Parkinson's patients

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:15.860
often becomes smaller.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.140
It's called micrographia.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.220
Involuntary hand tremors

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.810
cause irregular lines.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.420
This fits Huang Zhengming's
current symptoms.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.530
And in Lab 301,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.140
the skulls Huang Zhengming removed

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.010
have uneven cuts.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.010
But Liu Yuanyuan's skull

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.140
has a clean and precise cut.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.940
So with his condition,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.980
he couldn't have perform
such dismemberment?

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.420
Unless...

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.730
someone helped him.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.220
Wan,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.810
look into Huang Zhengming's
medical records.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.290
Check health insurance

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.050
and university reimbursements.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.250
Also, check his connections.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.810
Keep me posted in real-time.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.290
Based on

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.980
the estimated time of death,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.090
we've traced everyone

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.730
who entered the
specimen room after that.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.250
Liu Bingren.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.140
Xie Qiang.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.250
Wang Wenkai.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.140
Huang Zhengming.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.180
Zhang Zhiqi.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.980
Luo Kai.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.730
Gao Huilan.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.660
Wu Min. Eight people in total.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.180
We've got Huang's medical records.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.730
He's had Parkinson's for years.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.900
It's worsened this year.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.860
So he seldom gives lectures now.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.980
And his connections?

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.290
He never married,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.220
lives alone,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.810
and has little social interaction.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.180
Given the existing evidence,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.050
an accomplice

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.220
is highly improbable.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.050
He's not a people person.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.660
Well, let him go.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.220
Tell him not to leave the city

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.700
and be available for questioning.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.700
Su, go ahead.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.090
Okay. I'm on it.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.980
So we can

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.180
clear Huang Zhengming
for the time being.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.330
But a few points are clear.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:06.980
First,

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.140
the killer has

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.530
professional knowledge
and skills in dissection.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.290
Second,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.180
he knew the specimen room

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.090
and Huang Zhengming's Lab 301

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.010
are connected.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.380
So he

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.810
hid the body parts in the specimens

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.940
and mopped up blood

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.770
to lead us to the lab,

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.010
framing Huang Zhengming.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.290
I asked the building manager.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.770
He said

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.220
the specimen room and
Lab 301 were connected

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.940
over a decade ago.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.250
Recent years, they've been separate.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.940
Not many people know about this.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.620
Likely from the medical university,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.900
and they've been there

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.250
for quite some time.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.570
Based on our discussion,

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.770
of the people who entered

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.860
the specimen room

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.010
on the day Liu Yuanyuan died,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.420
only these three fit the profile.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.940
Let me explain

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.090
the features of squamous cell carcinoma.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.220
It's

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.050
most common

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.290
in people over 40.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.570
Su.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.420
Mr. Qi.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.660
Heard Huang Zhengming's
been cleared as a suspect.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.490
Yes.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.980
No evidence

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.980
ties him to the murder,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.420
or to an accomplice.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.420
What's wrong, Mr. Qi?

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.700
Mr. Huang!

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:54.810
Mr. Huang.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:56.940
Mr. Huang.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.660
Where did you

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.810
get this watch?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.530
Do I have to explain it to you?

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.810
Do you know Li Ming?

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.810
Are you interrogating me?

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.250
Fine.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.940
Show me the proper paperwork.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.250
No? Then don't waste my time.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.090
I only found

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.050
Li Ming's DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.090
in the car.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.140
But when you were unconscious,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.010
you saw someone.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.570
Your intuition and your memory

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.620
are unreliable.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.140
Qi Sizhe,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.570
you're refusing to face reality.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.420
You just can't convince yourself.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.730
Listen.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.380
Jiang City Medical University
is developing a new drug.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.250
If it succeeds,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.490
countless lives could be saved.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.810
Do you know what kind of patient

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.050
I dread most as a therapist?

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.810
Those who know they are asleep,

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.250
yet choose to keep dreaming.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.730
According to the clues

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.810
we've gathered today,

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.250
Liu Bingren and Wang Wenkai

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.570
registered and collected
cadavers on the morning

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.810
and afternoon

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.010
of the incident.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.700
After collecting the cadavers,

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.980
Liu Bingren went to the
lab building for class

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.330
and stayed until evening,

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.770
with students as witnesses.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.700
Wang Wenkai attended a
meeting at the admin building,

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.700
also with witnesses.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.980
So both have alibis.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:58.700
What about Gao Huilan?

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.140
Xi.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.570
She was accompanied by a student

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.490
when she went to

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.250
collect the cadaver.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.660
I asked that student.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.660
Nothing seemed off.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:08.730
So

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.980
all three have alibis?

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:11.770
Exactly.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.660
Great. All our work was for nothing.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.290
Xi, have you checked
Liu Yuanyuan's call records

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.330
and her bank statements?

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.220
Anything odd?

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.380
There are

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.090
no unusual transactions.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.490
And nothing suspicious

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.090
in her calls or receipts.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.980
Seems she lived a simple life.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.490
At the start of the case,

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.380
the store's footage,

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.050
Liu's knife, black plastic bags,

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.490
packing tape,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.050
gloves, hydrochloric acid, bleach,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.180
and rope.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.140
Why did she bring those
to the medical university?

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.380
We suspected

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.900
she was the killer

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.250
because she bought those.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.140
But then she died.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.980
Two possibilities.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.980
First, she went to the university

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.010
to conspire with
someone to commit murder.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.530
Or second,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.900
she went there to harm someone,

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.570
but ended up getting killed.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.570
Where did she go

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.090
after bringing those things

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.050
into the university?

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.900
I remember her former boss mentioned

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.810
she originally wanted

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.460
to get into the medical university.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.090
Could there be a connection

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.420
between the two?

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.940
It's a real shame.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:31.490
I heard

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.530
she did very well in high school

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.420
and was supposed to
attend medical university.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.980
But something happened,

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.420
so she was caring for

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.770
her sick mother.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.330
Something must have happened

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.620
when Liu Yuanyuan was in school.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.980
This might be a lead.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.140
Let's dig deeper into
Liu Yuanyuan's background.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.050
Check everyone she knew,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.530
every school she attended,

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.940
and any grudges she held.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.220
Besides, look into these three.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.570
See if they're connected

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.620
to Liu Yuanyuan.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.380
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.620
This is a good school.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.250
They say students here

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.010
never fail to get into top high schools.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.900
Hello.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.570
Police.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.220
Well, please.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.050
Thanks.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.220
Liu Yuanyuan won so many awards.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.700
Yes, I heard

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.660
she did well in her studies.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:32.770
However,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.010
I haven't been at this school long

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.620
and don't know much

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.700
about the school's work.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.980
But our school

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.050
has always taken student records

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.420
very seriously.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.140
This was

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.380
Liu Yuanyuan's homeroom teacher,

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.050
Ms. Lu.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.380
Hello.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:51.860
Hello.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.570
Hello,

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.620
we're the police.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.330
Have your seat.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:56.810
The principal briefed you?

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.140
We're here

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.810
to ask about

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.050
Liu Yuanyuan,

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.730
a former student of yours.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.770
Yes, he mentioned it.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.570
Even though

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:08.940
Yuan graduated years ago,

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.010
I remember her clearly.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.250
She was a student I valued highly.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.180
A top student

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.980
aspiring to be a doctor.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.810
I was quite confident she'd get into

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.900
the medical university.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.530
But she missed

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.420
her first college entrance exam.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.810
She missed it? Why?

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.380
It's said that she was seriously ill.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.290
She repeated her
senior year at our school.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.140
But her grades weren't great.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.570
Later I found out

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.140
she only took one exam

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.570
and left in the middle of it.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:37.980
Why?

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.860
I don't know.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.940
I tried to ask her,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.860
but I could never reach her again.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.250
Maybe you could ask

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.620
the invigilator from that year.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.090
Exactly.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.940
About the invigilator,

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.090
you can try checking
with the education bureau.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.180
Thanks.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.090
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.490
Can we take this back?

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.420
Should be fine.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.570
- Thanks.
- Okay.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.940
Mr. Han, here's Gao Huilan's info.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.770
Take a look.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.940
There was a student

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.380
with Gao Huilan at the time.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.530
What did she say?

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.570
Nothing unusual.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.090
Just standard procedure.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.940
Why did Ms. Gao only call for you?

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:28.980
Why not someone else?

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.140
Are you two close?

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.140
Actually, it's because we're not close.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.570
Not close?

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.570
What do you mean?

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.180
I kept failing my anatomy exams.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.620
Ms. Gao had no choice,

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.730
so she gave me some tips for the retake

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.180
while we transported the cadaver.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.250
Did you get all that?

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.220
Don't fail again.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.010
Though I'm studying medicine,

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.860
I'm pretty scared of corpses.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.490
Haven't gotten over it yet.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.290
This is my second retake.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.620
If I fail again,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.900
I will not graduate.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.420
Ms. Gao is nice.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:23.010
She doesn't want my efforts wasted.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.220
What happened when they
went to get the cadaver?

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.570
Gao Huilan and Wu Min
pushed a gurney together

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.900
and left the specimen room.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.860
Alright, let's go check.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.620
Hello,

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.420
do you remember this student?

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.900
She...

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.530
Yeah, I remember.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.530
It's been years.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.250
You still remember?

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.180
Because she looked like

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.290
a student I used to teach.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.570
But that student

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.010
went abroad long ago.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.740
So you had the wrong person.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.780
I checked the exam paper,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.820
and when I saw her name,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.340
I realized my mistake.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.050
Did you notice

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.570
anything unusual about her?

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.980
We heard she only took one exam

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:25.650
and left in the middle.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.690
She ran out of the exam room.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.090
No answer

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.090
when I called,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.900
and she ran off in a panic.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.170
What was

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.050
your student's name?

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:38.900
Ding Youmei.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.420
Thank you.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:46.980
Xi.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.090
Ms. Zhu.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:48.490
What's up?

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.570
I've found information

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.690
on Ding Youmei.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.380
She's an assistant professor

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.740
at He City Medical University.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.090
Ding Youmei is Gao Huilan's daughter.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.210
Fei,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.420
if only I had listened to Han Feng

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.210
and not let you become

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.050
a forensic doctor.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.490
Cross long over short

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.130
and knot it.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.860
That's how you make

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.780
a perfect knot.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.740
If you don't let me do it myself,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:22.780
how will I

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.170
become a good forensic doctor?

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:26.860
Alright, you do it.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.090
I want to find the truth

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.420
for those who can no longer speak

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.610
and let them

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.650
rest in peace.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.530
I believe you'll become

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.050
a great forensic doctor.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.940
If that day

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.090
I had answered your call sooner

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.340
and found you earlier,

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.380
you wouldn't...

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.300
But don't worry.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.300
I will find the truth

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.900
and let you rest in peace.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.490
The one in uniform is Liu Yuanyuan.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.420
The one with a mole between
her eyebrows is Ding Youmei.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.570
I suspect they swapped places.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.340
Swapped places?

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.740
Did Liu Yuanyuan come
to see you at the lab?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.780
Was Ding Youmei there?

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.650
She had been hurting us all along.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.820
This is all your fault!

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.260
I'll kill you!

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.340
Yuan's mother passed away.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.260
I understand everything Yuan did.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.940
We've checked all the school's cameras.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.210
Liu Yuanyuan left the
school through the main gate

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.490
after leaving the lab.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.380
What's this?

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.170
Human tissue.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.820
When moving a cadaver,

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.260
it's usually placed inside the bag.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.300
It's also the best
way to hide something.
