WEBVTT

02:21.542 --> 02:25.792
When the school asked him for an essay

02:26.542 --> 02:30.042
Nora chose without hesitation

02:34.375 --> 02:37.417
She mentioned the belly of the house

02:37.542 --> 02:41.000
as she ran down the stairs

02:42.042 --> 02:43.708
The house that was watching them

02:44.083 --> 02:46.583
to slip through the hole in the fence,

02:46.958 --> 02:50.375
before arriving on the street,

02:54.958 --> 02:59.208
Nora wondered if the house

03:00.042 --> 03:01.833
or heavy and inhabited.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.583
If the parquet floor liked being walked on,

03:06.500 --> 03:07.833
if the walls were ticklish.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.417
Did she ever feel pain?

03:20.125 --> 03:21.667
Nora thought that, surely,

03:22.042 --> 03:24.250
The house preferred to be full.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.542
Before them,

03:29.875 --> 03:34.083
generations of men and animals

03:36.208 --> 03:40.292
His great-great-grandfather

03:40.583 --> 03:42.292
where his grandmother was born,

03:42.458 --> 03:45.208
and where his parents now slept.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.708
The house was

03:55.083 --> 03:58.333
which appeared as soon as it was built,

03:59.750 --> 04:04.167
Nora wrote

04:05.417 --> 04:06.833
but in slow motion.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.667
Every year

04:10.042 --> 04:11.250
that his family had spent there

04:11.417 --> 04:13.625
were only a tiny second

04:13.792 --> 04:15.667
on the scale of this slow collapse.

04:24.292 --> 04:27.542
Upon returning to her writing, she was astonished

04:27.875 --> 04:31.708
for having chosen the word "noise"

04:32.417 --> 04:34.542
However, if the house didn't like noise,

04:36.000 --> 04:37.958
She hated silence.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.500
After his father left,

04:47.667 --> 04:50.417
The house no longer echoed

04:51.333 --> 04:54.667
But she already regretted it

05:00.583 --> 05:03.125
His teacher had loved his writing.

05:03.292 --> 05:04.958
His father too.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.125
She considered choosing her

05:07.458 --> 05:10.167
for his entrance oral exam

05:10.500 --> 05:13.833
But in hindsight,

05:14.042 --> 05:17.625
She finally performed the monologue

05:17.792 --> 05:20.833
I am a seagull. No. No.
I am an actress.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.167
SENTIMENTAL VALUE

05:47.667 --> 05:48.833
Nora ?

05:51.250 --> 05:54.208
- Nora? Will you open the door for me?
- I'm not going to be able to do it.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.750
- Nora, open up!
- Give me a second.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.208
Open it, please.

06:21.417 --> 06:22.458
Are you doing well ?

06:25.042 --> 06:28.417
I reread my text in peace and quiet.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.625
You know your lines.

06:34.167 --> 06:37.750
- It's not the first time.
- This time, it's not the same.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.958
I can't. I won't be able to do it.

06:41.125 --> 06:44.750
Okay. We need to breathe.
Shall we breathe together?

06:49.333 --> 06:50.583
Look at me.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.583
Breathe.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.542
Breathe with me.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.542
I can't do it with this thing.

06:59.708 --> 07:02.208
A costume designer will fix that for you, come on.

07:02.667 --> 07:03.833
Come on.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.875
- I'm thirsty, I have no water.
- You will drink downstairs.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.167
This is unacceptable.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.625
We're five minutes late.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.458
Don't worry.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.583
Get her on stage and it'll be fine.

07:32.125 --> 07:32.958
It's coming loose.

07:33.958 --> 07:35.500
No, it's fine.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.708
Tell me, could you...

08:05.875 --> 08:08.500
I need something, are you coming?

08:08.625 --> 08:09.625
NOW ?

08:18.083 --> 08:18.875
I'm nervous.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.375
I would need... I need...

08:21.750 --> 08:24.375
I need something.

08:27.958 --> 08:30.042
- We don't have time.
- Yes, it does.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.833
- Stop.
- We have time.

08:32.957 --> 08:35.250
- You're really...
- Hit me, then.

08:36.167 --> 08:39.042
- A little slap to give me a boost.
- Non.

08:39.207 --> 08:41.500
I won't be able to go on stage.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.125
How are you ?

08:46.667 --> 08:47.958
You're a pain in the ass!

09:16.292 --> 09:17.542
- Stop!
- I'm suffocating!

09:17.875 --> 09:19.500
Don't do that!

09:20.625 --> 09:21.792
Help me!

09:23.417 --> 09:25.208
You're going to tear it apart!

09:27.083 --> 09:28.125
Attends !

10:02.708 --> 10:03.625
Yngvar?

10:04.583 --> 10:05.417
Twenty seconds.

10:13.458 --> 10:14.250
Ready?

10:23.667 --> 10:25.125
We are ready.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.125
Yes.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.417
Listen!

11:40.083 --> 11:42.667
You promised to save me.

11:42.833 --> 11:45.583
But you sent me to the stake!

12:01.500 --> 12:05.083
I welcomed your children into my home.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.750
Despite that, you testified against me!

12:58.625 --> 13:00.667
We should have hired a caterer.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.125
- It's too stressful.
- Stop.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.167
It's nothing, it's fine.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.417
- Mom, can I have some cake?
- If you want.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.958
I just told him no.

13:26.292 --> 13:27.875
He's already stuffed himself.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.833
Please ?

13:30.750 --> 13:31.833
A healthy trick first.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.375
What a beautiful speech you gave!

13:35.000 --> 13:37.125
I spoke for both of us.

13:37.667 --> 13:41.583
Your mother was so proud of you,
She talked about you constantly.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.208
My dear Sissel...

13:46.375 --> 13:49.583
She often took me
at the National Theatre.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.167
This is where Grandma used to receive guests.
her patients before her illness.

14:56.750 --> 15:00.875
She spoke to them to help them.
In fact, it was mostly them who were talking.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.958
They were telling each other their secrets.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.208
And me, when I was little,
I was listening to them,

15:14.792 --> 15:16.500
through the stove.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.042
Did you have the right?

15:20.208 --> 15:22.125
No, but nobody knew.

15:24.458 --> 15:27.167
That was a while ago now...

15:27.500 --> 15:29.667
We no longer know if we should present

15:30.042 --> 15:32.292
condolences or congratulations.

15:32.458 --> 15:35.833
We had remained on good terms.

15:38.458 --> 15:39.583
What is it?

15:39.750 --> 15:40.875
Nothing.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.292
Dad is here.

15:49.292 --> 15:50.833
- Did you know that?
- Non.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.625
But I invited him.

15:58.667 --> 15:59.750
Hi, Dad.

16:01.292 --> 16:03.500
There you are! Excuse me.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.000
Hello, my darlings.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.083
- Have you seen Erik?
- No, he's here?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.208
You didn't come to church.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.417
I didn't have the courage.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.208
And why the church?
Did she have a mystical crisis?

16:22.375 --> 16:23.500
Non.

16:23.833 --> 16:24.875
It's prettier.

16:25.792 --> 16:26.875
It's really...

16:27.708 --> 16:28.542
That's really sad.

16:30.667 --> 16:33.625
She was a wonderful mother.
She was so beautiful...

16:34.458 --> 16:35.375
Belle ?

16:36.083 --> 16:37.208
As beautiful as you.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.000
And it was a head, too!

16:40.042 --> 16:41.375
She was always right.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.500
Say hello to Grandpa.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.333
Hey, buddy!

16:49.458 --> 16:50.583
Good morning.

16:53.875 --> 16:54.958
Good morning.

16:55.750 --> 16:56.542
It's Even.

16:57.042 --> 16:59.083
I recognize Evan, of course.

17:00.542 --> 17:02.042
We're old friends.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.958
How you've grown!

17:06.375 --> 17:08.791
Are you the tallest in your class?
- I don't think so.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.333
Don't you think so?

17:10.833 --> 17:12.541
Are you a real terror?

17:13.125 --> 17:14.583
Non ?

17:42.042 --> 17:42.833
Hold.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.958
I was just thinking about you.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.625
It's what ?

17:56.792 --> 17:57.958
My speakers.

18:01.042 --> 18:02.500
Are you doing well ?

18:03.292 --> 18:05.375
Yes, why?

18:05.500 --> 18:08.083
I'd like to see you before I leave.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.083
I have something to tell you.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.667
Can't you say it now?

18:14.542 --> 18:15.875
Not here.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.292
It's time we talked, you and I.

18:19.792 --> 18:20.875
Don't you think so?

18:25.750 --> 18:28.375
Fredrik will bring them back to me in his Toyota.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.292
Okay, thank you.

18:43.625 --> 18:46.333
I hope he doesn't imagine...

18:48.042 --> 18:50.542
that I need a dad, now.

18:52.167 --> 18:53.083
To console me.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.125
At least he's making an effort.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.792
It's not easy for him either.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.458
You will ask him
what he plans to do with the house.

19:05.583 --> 19:06.833
How so ?

19:07.042 --> 19:08.125
She belongs to him.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.583
Ah good ?

19:13.125 --> 19:16.583
He left it with my mother.
but they never signed anything.

19:20.042 --> 19:23.708
I admit that we,
We were counting on that money to some extent.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.542
You just have to talk to him about it.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.583
You never dare to contradict him.

19:33.042 --> 19:35.667
You believe that? Okay.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.000
Never.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.125
- Of course it does.
- Non.

20:02.583 --> 20:03.833
You are radiant.

20:04.958 --> 20:05.958
What are you having?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.333
A coffee will do.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.292
- Nothing else?
- Non.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.375
A coffee for this pretty young woman.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.292
- A coffee?
- Please.

20:15.458 --> 20:18.292
And you, everything's alright? Is everything okay?

20:18.583 --> 20:19.875
Served by you, everything is good.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.500
She thinks we're a couple.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.208
I'm worried about you.

20:35.458 --> 20:36.250
And you, how are you?

20:36.708 --> 20:39.333
Very good, things are moving along quite a bit.

20:40.792 --> 20:44.875
You are aware,
For my retrospective in France?

20:46.125 --> 20:47.750
No, how would I know?

20:48.125 --> 20:50.208
But most importantly, I'm going to shoot a film.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.167
You're hanging on.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.958
This is my best script.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.583
Michael said the same thing.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.000
Michael is still producing?

21:02.167 --> 21:04.375
He says I'm coming back into fashion.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.250
My documentary is presented
pretty much everywhere.

21:07.417 --> 21:08.958
I'm on a roll.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.042
Did you want to talk to me about something?

21:20.708 --> 21:21.667
Yes.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.583
My film tells the story...

21:32.542 --> 21:34.750
of a young woman, a young mother who...

21:39.542 --> 21:41.542
I want you to play the lead role.

21:49.958 --> 21:51.500
I wrote it for you.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.208
You're the only one who can play it.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.000
THANKS.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.833
But you've never seen me play.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.625
Yes, several times.
I saw you in Medea .

22:18.167 --> 22:20.375
You left during the intermission.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.792
I don't like the theatre.

22:22.167 --> 22:24.167
And the sets were hideous.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.875
But you, you were fine.

22:27.542 --> 22:30.792
In two minutes,
I know what an actor is worth.

22:31.750 --> 22:35.292
This role would do you good
at all levels.

22:36.167 --> 22:38.125
That would suit you better.

22:38.458 --> 22:42.375
that these dusty rooms
staged for a retired audience.

22:43.583 --> 22:45.500
It's a real movie role.

22:46.625 --> 22:50.375
Thanks to me,
You might even find some money.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.292
My series did very well.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.000
Yes, that can help.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.625
I spoke to Michael.

22:58.125 --> 23:00.958
He is convinced
that the funding will be found.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.958
We'll film at home.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.208
In our house?

23:05.500 --> 23:07.792
Yes, that will be perfect.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.792
Don't count on me.

23:20.958 --> 23:23.208
Your series can do without you.

23:23.708 --> 23:25.417
Filming is complete.

23:26.042 --> 23:27.958
You're worth more than all that.

23:29.042 --> 23:30.125
Did you see it?

23:30.458 --> 23:31.458
Of course.

23:31.583 --> 23:33.000
And what do you think?

23:33.875 --> 23:35.625
It doesn't matter.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.583
I really want to know
What do you think about it?

23:40.958 --> 23:44.250
It's not my thing.
It's not visual enough.

23:45.292 --> 23:48.625
We can see neither your face nor your eyes.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.292
But we don't care,
because the public loves it.

23:53.750 --> 23:57.333
What interests me,
That's what you think.

23:59.750 --> 24:02.292
It's not you.
that's the problem.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.083
The role I'm offering you

24:05.250 --> 24:06.875
would allow you to break through.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.958
We're not going to work together, Dad.

24:12.208 --> 24:13.667
We can't even talk to each other.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.417
Read it, at least, and I'll call you.

24:16.708 --> 24:18.167
Stop calling me!

24:18.583 --> 24:20.292
It's obvious you're drunk.

24:20.583 --> 24:21.417
I'm worried.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.750
I forbid you to worry about me.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.125
At least read it!

24:26.458 --> 24:27.500
What for?

24:27.958 --> 24:30.000
It's going to fall through anyway.

26:00.208 --> 26:01.875
Remain seated.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.083
Above all, don't move.

27:33.958 --> 27:36.667
I was next to you during the film,

27:36.833 --> 27:39.042
And I noticed, while looking at you,

27:39.375 --> 27:42.083
that you were very, very moved.

27:45.458 --> 27:46.708
Yes.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.625
Forgive me.

27:51.083 --> 27:54.875
It had been twenty years
that I hadn't seen it.

27:55.417 --> 27:58.417
And I have very vivid memories,
very precise

27:58.542 --> 28:01.083
from that era...

28:02.042 --> 28:03.750
from the filming,

28:04.542 --> 28:05.792
of the team.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.375
I make films with my friends.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.042
We are a family.

28:14.750 --> 28:18.250
This is especially true
For this film, I believe?

28:18.750 --> 28:21.167
Are you talking about my daughter, Agnes?

28:22.583 --> 28:24.500
She's the one who plays Anna.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.042
I have one last question

28:32.500 --> 28:34.458
And I'm not the only one asking myself that question.

28:34.750 --> 28:38.417
You haven't made any more films
since L'Idylle ,

28:38.542 --> 28:39.958
fifteen years ago.

28:40.583 --> 28:44.167
Will there be another film by Gustav Borg?

28:46.000 --> 28:47.708
I certainly hope so!

28:48.792 --> 28:51.792
I hope so too. Thank you, Mr. Borg.

29:21.333 --> 29:22.167
Gustav !

29:24.833 --> 29:26.958
Excuse me.
You know, Rachel Kemp...

29:27.292 --> 29:30.333
She loved your film
And she would like to have dinner with you.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.208
She's at Excelsior.

29:32.875 --> 29:34.042
Do you know it?

29:35.125 --> 29:38.000
It is the festival that invites,
That goes without saying.

29:55.833 --> 29:57.042
It's a private party.

29:57.375 --> 29:58.708
Gustav Borg!

30:02.000 --> 30:03.292
Thank you for coming!

30:03.583 --> 30:05.167
I'm going to get a chair.

30:06.167 --> 30:07.667
- Here.
- THANKS.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.208
I was impressed.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.542
through your film.

30:13.583 --> 30:15.417
A true masterpiece.

30:15.708 --> 30:16.750
A very beautiful film.

30:17.583 --> 30:18.542
THANKS.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.458
- Exceptional.
- Gorgeous.

30:21.042 --> 30:22.083
And your projection?

30:23.042 --> 30:24.333
It went well.

30:24.625 --> 30:25.500
A true triumph.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.208
The audience loved the film.
Adored Rachel.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.708
It's coming out in the fall, don't miss it.

30:41.042 --> 30:42.417
- How do I do it?
- Lower it.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.875
I dream of making films
like yours.

31:17.958 --> 31:20.292
I understood it today.

31:23.958 --> 31:26.792
I had never seen a film like it.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.167
He really...

31:32.542 --> 31:33.583
Really...

31:34.958 --> 31:36.083
moved.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.458
THANKS.

31:53.167 --> 31:56.083
It's been a while
that I want to take a break.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.875
But I'm going to take on a series of projects...

32:03.292 --> 32:05.250
The roles are pretty good.

32:06.708 --> 32:08.667
But I don't recognize myself in it.

32:09.250 --> 32:10.333
So, refuse them!

32:12.583 --> 32:15.708
Sam would lose it,
if I gave up on everything.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.292
And that would be understandable.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.625
Sam, screw him!

32:21.792 --> 32:23.542
It's your life.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.125
And you ?

32:29.792 --> 32:31.292
Do you have a project in progress?

32:32.208 --> 32:34.042
No. I thought so, but...

32:34.792 --> 32:36.250
No funding?

32:38.500 --> 32:39.500
Something like that.

33:19.167 --> 33:21.125
He will take you back to the hotel.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.083
THANKS.

33:28.042 --> 33:30.167
- I enjoyed this meeting.
- Me too.

33:32.708 --> 33:34.083
Rachel !

33:35.542 --> 33:36.583
Sir !

33:37.542 --> 33:39.292
Rachel, your phone!

34:23.750 --> 34:25.417
Weren't you supposed to go?

34:25.708 --> 34:27.208
Are you kicking me out?

34:28.042 --> 34:30.167
Before you switch into... mode

34:30.958 --> 34:33.042
cuddly and tender.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.167
Don't you like hugs?

34:35.583 --> 34:38.333
Yes, I do like hugs.

34:38.625 --> 34:39.833
Does that scare you?

34:40.375 --> 34:41.583
Intimacy?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.667
It doesn't seem easy for you.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.125
No, indeed.

34:48.625 --> 34:51.500
I'm perfectly fine with you being married.

34:51.667 --> 34:55.833
That way, I don't have to take responsibility.
to be a complete nutcase.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.667
Seriously? You're being too hard on yourself.

34:58.833 --> 35:00.875
How crazy is she?

35:04.708 --> 35:06.333
On a scale of 1 to 100?

35:06.500 --> 35:07.583
80.

35:09.292 --> 35:12.500
- 80.
- There's still 20 percent left...

35:13.167 --> 35:14.583
This is the visible part.

35:19.167 --> 35:21.708
Did you speak to the theatre director?

35:21.875 --> 35:23.833
He advised me...

35:24.667 --> 35:26.625
to go see a therapist.

35:26.792 --> 35:27.958
GOOD !

35:28.125 --> 35:30.875
- Why not ?
Don't say that!

35:31.083 --> 35:33.875
No, but it's true.
that you're a bit phobic.

35:34.083 --> 35:36.208
I could help you manage that.

35:36.375 --> 35:39.250
We shouldn't dramatize it.
It only happened to me once...

35:39.583 --> 35:40.667
I had to slap you.

35:40.833 --> 35:42.208
It's true.

35:43.417 --> 35:44.292
Sorry.

35:44.583 --> 35:46.542
It was violent...

35:47.250 --> 35:49.292
You could file a complaint.

35:49.458 --> 35:52.417
- I promise, I'll never do that.
- Please.

35:52.708 --> 35:54.292
I know myself a little too well.

35:54.583 --> 35:57.000
- I'm not going to see a shrink.
- You should!

35:58.083 --> 35:59.750
- Non.
- For what ?

35:59.958 --> 36:03.792
My mother was... She was a psychologist.

36:04.208 --> 36:05.667
You're not going to see your mother.

36:06.625 --> 36:07.875
Kiss me again.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.708
Okay, but...

36:10.625 --> 36:12.333
On a fini.

36:17.458 --> 36:18.875
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

36:45.042 --> 36:46.500
To go on stage,

36:46.833 --> 36:49.042
It's not an intuitive thing.

36:49.208 --> 36:53.375
Your whole body is on alert,
The audience is watching you...

36:54.167 --> 36:55.333
You can't hide.

36:55.625 --> 36:58.167
But it's not just anxiety?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.375
No, I love it!

37:02.708 --> 37:05.042
Actually...

37:05.792 --> 37:08.708
She feels frustrated.
anger

37:09.250 --> 37:12.500
a feeling of injustice,
because she has to take responsibility for everything.

37:12.667 --> 37:14.708
If she accuses him of being a coward,

37:14.875 --> 37:18.958
It's because she's a coward.
and can't stand it in her own home.

37:19.125 --> 37:21.833
What I prefer,

37:22.875 --> 37:25.000
It's about stepping into a character,

37:25.333 --> 37:28.375
adopt his point of view,

37:28.667 --> 37:29.500
his feelings.

37:30.792 --> 37:32.708
To become someone else,

37:33.208 --> 37:37.042
That reassures me in relation to
to my own feelings.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.708
Don't you want to be yourself?

37:41.208 --> 37:42.208
That's what you're saying.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.292
What would Mom have said about that?

37:52.417 --> 37:54.333
You're cheating, back off!

37:56.708 --> 37:57.958
No, not that far.

37:58.125 --> 38:00.500
No, wait. Here!

38:03.625 --> 38:05.375
Do you have a boyfriend?

38:10.125 --> 38:12.167
No, not really.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.667
Don't you want some?

38:18.792 --> 38:20.125
And.

38:21.542 --> 38:23.333
But it's not always easy.

38:27.167 --> 38:28.625
I love you.

38:31.292 --> 38:32.667
I love you too.

38:35.417 --> 38:37.333
When I grow up, we're going to get married.

38:42.833 --> 38:45.750
That's kind of you to say.
But that's not possible.

38:45.958 --> 38:47.167
I know.

38:53.417 --> 38:54.792
Did you fall asleep too?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.500
Non.

38:57.125 --> 38:58.875
He's just too cute!

39:01.292 --> 39:04.708
I was even entitled
to a marriage proposal.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.542
Congratulations.

39:07.708 --> 39:09.625
Thank you. It's not an everyday occurrence.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.625
We were coming back from the park a little while ago,

39:14.208 --> 39:16.375
He looked at me and said:

39:16.500 --> 39:17.583
"I see you."

39:20.542 --> 39:22.292
- Where did he get that from?
- No idea.

39:22.458 --> 39:23.333
Is that what you're saying?

39:23.500 --> 39:25.458
He must have heard it at school.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.583
Do they say "I see you" at school?

39:29.500 --> 39:30.792
How are you ?

39:32.667 --> 39:33.750
Sorry.

39:34.542 --> 39:35.375
It'll be OK ?

39:36.250 --> 39:38.167
It's okay. I'm going home.

39:40.292 --> 39:41.292
Attends.

39:42.042 --> 39:42.833
It'll be OK.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.417
Are you sure?

39:46.333 --> 39:48.750
Are you sure? Nothing happened?

39:49.458 --> 39:50.542
Sorry.

40:11.750 --> 40:12.708
It'll be OK ?

40:13.083 --> 40:14.000
Yes.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.500
Do you think... she could do it again?

40:21.625 --> 40:23.125
No, I don't think so.

40:24.958 --> 40:26.792
She just feels a little lonely.

40:29.458 --> 40:30.750
Does that worry you?

40:31.500 --> 40:32.583
A little.

40:56.333 --> 40:57.542
Hello.

41:31.500 --> 41:32.792
That feels strange.

41:34.417 --> 41:37.583
When Mom got sick,
I considered it for a while

41:38.125 --> 41:41.250
to take over the house
to live here with Even and Erik.

41:41.875 --> 41:44.042
- Would you have liked to live here?
- Non.

41:45.125 --> 41:47.750
Anyway,
We can't afford to buy it back.

41:56.208 --> 41:57.875
I've already sorted all of that.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.250
They're old papers.

42:01.833 --> 42:05.417
Thanks anyway,
You did a great job.

42:05.542 --> 42:07.167
I am impressed.

42:09.292 --> 42:11.333
Throw away what you don't want.

42:11.500 --> 42:14.375
You don't want anything?
There are some nice things.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.542
Which have sentimental value.

42:16.708 --> 42:17.958
You can watch.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.208
I would gladly take that vase.

42:22.333 --> 42:23.750
It's true, he's handsome.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.958
Because I want it?

42:26.292 --> 42:28.333
No. Take it, if you want.

42:28.625 --> 42:32.750
No, the idea,
It's about reaching an agreement.

42:34.167 --> 42:35.500
I'll take it, then.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.500
Don't forget to turn off the stove!

42:59.375 --> 43:01.458
Is he going to live here for a long time?

43:01.583 --> 43:03.042
He didn't specify.

43:04.083 --> 43:06.292
He came to handle the sale?

43:08.083 --> 43:09.375
I'm not really sure.

43:10.208 --> 43:12.625
He arrives at 2 PM.
You can ask him.

43:14.583 --> 43:15.667
I don't think so, no.

43:16.125 --> 43:18.167
Are you going to ignore it for much longer?

43:18.500 --> 43:19.708
I'll try.

43:23.708 --> 43:27.000
I believed it too
that he had come to take care of the sale.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.042
But he has a project underway.

43:32.500 --> 43:33.750
Pardon ?

43:34.625 --> 43:38.042
That's rather positive.
He's going to make a new film.

43:39.875 --> 43:41.167
What movie?

43:42.875 --> 43:44.125
The one he offered you.

43:44.458 --> 43:46.625
My film?
The role he wrote for me?

43:46.792 --> 43:48.583
Yes, the role you turned down.

43:50.750 --> 43:51.708
Does he have the funding?

43:52.375 --> 43:53.625
J'imagine.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.417
I think he wants to talk to you about it.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.750
He asked if you would be there.

44:05.375 --> 44:06.167
Is that him?

44:07.000 --> 44:07.875
Yes.

44:26.375 --> 44:28.167
Amazing! Isn't that Rachel Kemp?

44:39.958 --> 44:40.792
Shit !

44:41.292 --> 44:42.500
Attends, Nora !

44:42.833 --> 44:44.250
But wait...

44:48.125 --> 44:49.792
Nothing has changed.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.292
Great to see you again.

45:09.792 --> 45:12.250
There's a cafe two minutes from here.

45:12.417 --> 45:14.125
Rachel will call you.

45:24.292 --> 45:25.250
Is Nora here?

45:25.750 --> 45:27.167
No, she had to leave.

45:30.167 --> 45:31.708
This is my daughter, Agnes.

45:31.875 --> 45:33.875
- Hello. Rachel.
- Pleased to meet you.

45:34.250 --> 45:35.292
Me too.

45:36.667 --> 45:38.500
Are you in the film industry too?

45:39.500 --> 45:41.583
She sometimes does
Research for me.

45:41.750 --> 45:45.250
I am a historian. An academic.

45:45.542 --> 45:48.250
Sorry, I'm stumbling over my words.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.875
Do you recognize her?

45:54.458 --> 45:56.417
She played Anna in my film.

45:56.708 --> 45:57.583
A long time ago.

45:59.333 --> 46:00.542
But of course!

46:01.833 --> 46:02.625
Anna !

46:03.625 --> 46:05.208
Yes, I recognize you.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.208
Can we take a selfie?

46:08.833 --> 46:10.875
- Why not ?
- You're a star!

46:19.167 --> 46:20.208
THANKS.

46:22.417 --> 46:24.625
She is here, she is talking to her son.

46:24.792 --> 46:27.417
This is the final scene, the end.

46:27.542 --> 46:29.625
She prepares food for him.

46:29.792 --> 46:33.875
It's important to her.
like a final act of maternal care.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.833
He gives her a hug before leaving.

46:38.958 --> 46:42.958
From the moment the door closes,
Her expression changes.

46:43.292 --> 46:46.167
She seems to be relaxing.
You see?

46:48.458 --> 46:51.958
The little boy must find his father.
She's not in a hurry.

46:52.833 --> 46:56.542
Here, there is a clothesline.
How do you say it?

46:56.708 --> 46:58.000
A clothesline.

46:58.583 --> 47:01.042
- A clothesline.
- So.

47:01.583 --> 47:04.958
Then she enters this room
and puts everything in place.

47:11.042 --> 47:12.250
Suddenly...

47:14.208 --> 47:16.208
She hears another door open.

47:16.375 --> 47:17.375
Follow me.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.125
That's his son.

47:26.083 --> 47:28.417
He forgot his Norwegian flag.

47:28.875 --> 47:32.500
Yes, it's May 17th.
your national holiday.

47:33.667 --> 47:36.083
Did I tell you it's a sequence shot?

47:37.167 --> 47:39.792
Just one shot? The whole scene?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.042
The entire ending will be in a single shot.

47:42.208 --> 47:43.333
No assembly required.

47:43.500 --> 47:46.333
Perfect synchronization
of time and space.

47:48.375 --> 47:49.375
SO...

47:50.500 --> 47:53.125
The boy freezes, he stares at her.

47:54.333 --> 47:56.792
Something's wrong, he doesn't know what.

48:00.125 --> 48:02.542
But he grabs his flag

48:02.708 --> 48:03.833
and runs off.

48:06.542 --> 48:07.750
She comes this way.

48:07.958 --> 48:10.500
to ensure that this time,
He's off to a good start.

48:11.583 --> 48:14.167
We can hear the garden gate
to close behind him.

48:14.333 --> 48:17.000
The camera remains focused on her.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.583
And that's crucial.

48:21.208 --> 48:23.042
The expression on his face.

48:25.583 --> 48:27.208
What is she thinking about?

48:27.833 --> 48:29.167
Exactly.

48:32.250 --> 48:33.875
Then she goes back there.

48:54.042 --> 48:55.792
Is this where she takes action?

48:56.000 --> 48:56.958
Yes.

49:05.667 --> 49:07.667
Would it support its weight?

49:09.500 --> 49:11.708
That's how it happened for my mother.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.083
Your mother?

49:22.250 --> 49:23.458
But not here?

49:24.000 --> 49:24.875
And.

49:25.625 --> 49:27.542
That was a long time ago.

49:28.208 --> 49:29.125
Non !

49:29.583 --> 49:30.667
With this stool.

49:33.875 --> 49:35.125
This stool?

49:37.083 --> 49:39.000
She climbed on top of it.

49:40.875 --> 49:42.542
But we won't see the scene.

49:43.625 --> 49:47.250
The shot ends at the door
which closes behind her.

49:47.792 --> 49:49.500
We will only hear it.

49:52.042 --> 49:53.542
Then the camera moves back.

49:59.542 --> 50:03.375
Why didn't you leave?
The house, after that?

50:03.667 --> 50:05.750
We left.

50:06.208 --> 50:07.667
In Sweden, my father was Swedish.

50:11.292 --> 50:13.500
I would like you to tell me about her.

50:16.250 --> 50:18.875
That's not my mother, in the script.

50:24.250 --> 50:26.208
But will they let me do it?

50:26.750 --> 50:29.458
Yes, yes, I know.

50:29.583 --> 50:31.083
It's going to be good.

50:31.250 --> 50:32.292
She's totally into it.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.250
I told him about this stool

50:35.958 --> 50:38.125
had been used in my mother's suicide.

50:39.208 --> 50:40.542
The IKEA stool?

50:58.167 --> 50:59.542
Is that me?

51:02.125 --> 51:06.542
Is that really me?
With these thoughts, these sleepless nights?

51:06.875 --> 51:08.500
I can't accept it

51:10.417 --> 51:11.708
that it really is me.

51:12.333 --> 51:13.500
We've already talked about this.

51:14.583 --> 51:16.792
You no longer recognize yourself?

51:17.000 --> 51:18.083
Non.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.958
Many years ago,

51:21.125 --> 51:23.958
the consulting room

51:28.625 --> 51:30.375
It was often empty.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.833
and Karin, the eldest in the family,

51:33.042 --> 51:36.375
She loved meeting up with her friends there.

52:04.083 --> 52:08.458
During the War,

52:09.292 --> 52:12.375
One autumn evening in 1943,

52:12.500 --> 52:14.250
The militia came to arrest him.

52:21.667 --> 52:24.042
She was imprisoned for two years.

52:24.625 --> 52:26.375
She never mentioned her stay

52:35.417 --> 52:37.042
There, you can listen.

52:38.375 --> 52:39.958
After the Liberation,

52:40.292 --> 52:43.167
Karin's Maria

52:45.792 --> 52:47.875
She gave birth to Gustav

52:48.250 --> 52:49.500
in 1951.

52:56.250 --> 52:58.875
Years later, having become a filmmaker,

52:59.500 --> 53:00.833
Gustav liked to say:

53:01.208 --> 53:03.875
"Nothing is more beautiful than shadows."

53:04.583 --> 53:08.542
He was then seeing

53:53.083 --> 53:54.875
Karin's little sister, Edith,

53:55.250 --> 53:57.250
with her friend, Lillian.

53:58.292 --> 53:59.958
Edith had not wanted children.

54:00.625 --> 54:03.208
but she was welcoming Gustav

54:10.375 --> 54:12.833
In case of complaints,

54:13.875 --> 54:16.583
she was certain

54:16.958 --> 54:18.792
who had denounced his sister

54:28.042 --> 54:29.208
Upon the death of his aunt,

54:29.500 --> 54:31.125
Gustav inherited the house.

54:32.750 --> 54:35.000
In 1986, he returned to settle

54:35.167 --> 54:36.875
within these walls filled with memories.

54:41.250 --> 54:43.958
There are two versions

54:44.292 --> 54:45.083
and his wife, Sissel.

54:46.042 --> 54:49.417
She recounted that he had consulted her.

54:50.167 --> 54:52.792
She had deduced from this

54:53.000 --> 54:56.042
was more complicated for him

54:56.500 --> 54:58.542
Gustav's version

54:58.708 --> 55:01.000
I was overwhelmed by her beauty.

55:01.417 --> 55:03.833
When I learned

55:04.250 --> 55:05.875
I invented problems for myself.

55:06.500 --> 55:09.042
Six months later,

55:10.542 --> 55:13.417
They were married three weeks ago

55:13.542 --> 55:15.625
in December 1987.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.500
With the arrival of little Agnes,

55:26.083 --> 55:27.792
Are you fed up with being with us?

55:28.000 --> 55:29.500
I never said that!

55:29.667 --> 55:32.500
You always bring me up
The same old nonsense!

55:35.292 --> 55:37.958
After the divorce,

55:39.958 --> 55:42.792
The house became lighter and lighter.

56:06.167 --> 56:07.583
Did you talk to Peter?

56:09.500 --> 56:12.042
Peter is an old man.

56:13.292 --> 56:15.417
He hasn't worked for ten years.

56:15.875 --> 56:17.125
Like me.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.750
He has retired.

56:21.583 --> 56:23.292
I'm going to talk to him.

56:26.167 --> 56:29.042
- I don't want another director of photography.
- Okay, but...

56:29.625 --> 56:32.500
Go see him, then.

56:32.625 --> 56:33.833
If you want.

56:35.500 --> 56:36.667
You'd better.

56:37.958 --> 56:39.625
He's no older than you.

56:42.167 --> 56:43.750
Do you like Norway?

56:44.458 --> 56:46.833
I love Norway.
It's magnificent.

56:47.750 --> 56:49.125
And the Norwegians

56:49.458 --> 56:51.667
They are adorable.
The welcome is so warm.

56:54.833 --> 56:57.458
It's a Netflix production.

56:58.083 --> 57:00.042
Will the film be released in cinemas?

57:00.208 --> 57:02.083
Where else would he come from?

57:02.875 --> 57:06.000
Negotiations are ongoing.
But that's what's planned.

57:09.083 --> 57:11.125
A question for Rachel Kemp.

57:11.458 --> 57:13.542
Regarding the critical reception

57:13.875 --> 57:16.042
from your latest film,
Cathy's Choice.

57:16.208 --> 57:18.583
You're not too disappointed?

57:22.167 --> 57:24.417
I am very proud of this film.

57:26.250 --> 57:28.000
But we are not there.

57:28.333 --> 57:30.458
to talk about that, I think.

57:31.125 --> 57:32.833
You are apprehensive about embarking

57:33.625 --> 57:35.792
In a real dramatic film?

57:36.167 --> 57:38.667
I want to film...
I chose this film because...

57:38.833 --> 57:41.667
What kind of stupid question is that?

57:43.167 --> 57:46.125
Rachel Kemp is the best actress
of his generation.

57:46.292 --> 57:48.750
Thank her instead for being here.
You ungrateful wretch!

57:50.625 --> 57:51.750
Out !

57:53.083 --> 57:54.083
Out !

57:56.083 --> 57:56.875
THANKS.

57:58.958 --> 58:00.583
What a huge jerk!

58:01.792 --> 58:03.083
You didn't ask

58:03.417 --> 58:05.083
To validate the questions?

58:05.417 --> 58:06.875
That's not right.

58:07.542 --> 58:09.167
Satan the TikTok troll.

58:35.542 --> 58:36.750
He taught it to me.

58:37.250 --> 58:39.333
I did it with him, too.

58:39.500 --> 58:42.458
I'm not going to give a long speech,

58:42.583 --> 58:46.583
But I am overwhelmed.
by a wave of gratitude.

58:46.958 --> 58:48.750
I really love working

58:49.125 --> 58:50.708
with each of you.

58:51.083 --> 58:53.083
We still have work to do, but...

58:53.417 --> 58:54.875
We were just talking about that.

58:56.208 --> 58:58.875
- You and I have sorted things out.
- Not all of it.

58:59.250 --> 59:01.500
We'll see the rest on stage.

59:02.042 --> 59:05.750
Jakob, I know that at home,
It's complicated.

59:07.667 --> 59:09.500
In any case...

59:10.000 --> 59:12.667
Please don't let your job suffer.

59:13.042 --> 59:15.708
And if you need to talk about it,
I am here.

59:16.333 --> 59:17.875
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.750
More...

59:20.583 --> 59:22.500
We're going to tear it up!

59:23.958 --> 59:25.167
That's for sure.

59:25.333 --> 59:26.417
Health !

59:29.375 --> 59:31.792
Why didn't you tell me?
That you were going to get a divorce?

59:33.292 --> 59:36.292
Between rehearsals and everything else...

59:41.500 --> 59:44.417
I haven't really had the opportunity.

59:44.542 --> 59:45.625
I understand.

59:47.958 --> 59:49.375
It's not...

59:52.333 --> 59:53.667
Because of us?

59:53.833 --> 59:55.542
No, absolutely not.

01:00:00.042 --> 01:00:00.833
I am here,

01:00:01.167 --> 01:00:02.500
If you want...

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:04.958
If you need to talk.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.167
We no longer need to hide.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.333
Listen, I'm not sure.

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.375
Cuckoo !

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:15.542
- Is Dad here?
- Not yet.

01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:22.417
Here it is! Happy birthday!

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:25.500
You look so handsome.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:29.667
Are you making a pizza?

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:31.667
- Hello! Is this how we do it?
- So.

01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:38.708
I still hold the record.

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:40.500
Non.

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:42.958
Start there.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.042
Welcome.

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:56.417
- Glad to see you.
- Me too.

01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:58.542
Hi, grandpa.

01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:02.000
9 years old, a real man!

01:02:02.167 --> 01:02:03.708
You're a big boy.

01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:06.625
You haven't seen Therese again
since our wedding.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.125
But Therese is an unforgettable woman.

01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:17.542
You're spoiling us! What grape variety is it?

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:19.375
Go get us some glasses.

01:02:32.417 --> 01:02:33.500
Hi, Dad.

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:45.167
Did you get it?

01:02:50.292 --> 01:02:51.208
Is the film progressing well?

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.333
Instead.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500
I've heard about it, it's great!

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:01.500
How does it work?
With Rachel Kemp?

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:02.875
Stop.

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:07.083
I still have the right
to ask the question.

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.750
She still has a long way to go.

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:12.292
But it is progressing.

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:14.542
I heard the story
from the IKEA stool.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:19.667
Is he going to stay stuck to that thing?

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:23.167
He has twenty minutes left
of screen time.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:24.792
To whom? To Even?

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:30.833
Do you have any screen time left?

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.542
You haven't used it up yet?

01:03:33.958 --> 01:03:35.000
My screen time?

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:36.625
How much are you giving him?

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:38.042
Ten minutes.

01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:40.750
- Put down your phone.
- The pizza is ready.

01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:42.958
- It's ready.
- I'm coming.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.458
- What do we say?
- Thank you, Grandfather.

01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:59.708
Look at.

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:01.542
Monica Bellucci, bon sang !

01:04:03.792 --> 01:04:06.083
Thanks to this film,
you will understand women

01:04:06.417 --> 01:04:08.125
and their relationship with the mother.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.125
Beautiful gifts.

01:04:10.292 --> 01:04:12.083
We don't have a DVD player.

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:13.167
Thank goodness!

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:15.625
A solution will be found.

01:04:15.792 --> 01:04:17.333
We rarely watch movies.

01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:53.625
You should take up writing.

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:57.292
If you say so.

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:00.667
Why wait around?
while waiting for some old jerk

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:02.625
Are you being offered the role of Ophelia?

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:03.875
I'm playing Hamlet.

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:05.083
It's true ?

01:05:05.458 --> 01:05:06.875
I spoke to Rachel about it,

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.875
She took matters into her own hands.

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:11.458
She set up her own production company.

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:14.375
It's difficult being an actress.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.708
They decide nothing.

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:18.458
they are dependent
of the desires of others.

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:20.167
It's exhausting.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.500
I play a lot...

01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:24.750
They end up doubting themselves.

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:28.042
and their need for recognition
becomes...

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:29.625
intolerable.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:34.375
I would never have married an actress.

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:37.458
You preferred to put them in your bed.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.417
Today's artists

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:43.750
They are so petty-bourgeois.

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:45.833
We don't write Ulysses

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:49.250
when you're managing kids' football
or car insurance.

01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:53.417
A true artist is free.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.958
And it must remain so.

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:00.083
So, you shouldn't have children then?

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.125
Don't say that, Nora.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.292
How old are you?

01:06:10.042 --> 01:06:13.542
At your age, Sissel had two children.

01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:15.708
Times are changing, Dad.

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:20.833
You are the best thing that ever happened to me.

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:23.250
What's the best thing that's ever happened to you?

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:25.167
We haven't seen you often.

01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:31.500
As per usual,
It's all Dad's fault.

01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:35.458
I didn't miss everything,
You are good women.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.583
Are you sure?

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:40.583
You don't know us.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.625
- You're exaggerating.
Am I exaggerating?

01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:52.417
You've had some difficult times.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.500
I've experienced that too.

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:59.708
But you have too much anger inside you.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.208
It's difficult to love a madwoman.

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:08.750
You don't want to end up alone, do you?

01:07:13.417 --> 01:07:15.583
Artistically, it's bad too.

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:19.500
You need to have someone to love,
children, or...

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:23.958
You never regret them, right?

01:09:58.375 --> 01:09:59.292
Peter ?

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.667
I'm glad to see you.

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.333
What a house!

01:10:07.417 --> 01:10:11.500
It's thanks to Lasse Hallström,
Not to you.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:15.500
Without The River of Time ,
He would never have hired you.

01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:18.333
Your grandchildren must love it.

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:23.375
We're still on bad terms with Daniel.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.292
It's a real shame for her children.

01:10:27.292 --> 01:10:29.750
He is depriving them of their grandfather.

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:32.167
But tell me...

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.708
this scenario...

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:37.583
Not bad, huh?

01:10:38.042 --> 01:10:40.542
- He's great.
- You in es?

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:43.292
Of course I'm in!

01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:46.167
Come on, let's go have a drink.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:04.208
In this film, we won't

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.583
shoulder-mounted camera.

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:07.792
I see more of a dolly

01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:09.292
and a fixed camera.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.417
Sorry we lost touch.

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:21.750
Between filming, I forget...

01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:24.458
I know what it's like, I'm the same.

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:31.292
Listen...

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:33.875
I'll keep you updated.

01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.958
Netflix also has a say in this.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.667
They want me to see other people.

01:11:50.875 --> 01:11:52.750
Is that how it works?

01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:56.125
Yes.

01:11:57.833 --> 01:11:59.208
That's how it is.

01:12:19.042 --> 01:12:20.417
Let's drink to that, then!

01:12:22.083 --> 01:12:23.500
Glad to see you.

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:13.042
Hi, Nora.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:15.500
I'm calling you because...

01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:23.583
Because we need to talk.

01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:28.792
We can't continue like this.

01:13:31.792 --> 01:13:35.333
If I don't like going to the theatre,

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.708
that doesn't mean
that I don't like the theatre.

01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:40.500
It's more that...

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.625
I can't stand watching it.

01:13:46.417 --> 01:13:48.292
Chekhov, I can...

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:50.958
I prefer to read Chekhov.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500
Maybe...

01:13:54.292 --> 01:13:56.250
Not the parts, but...

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:02.792
I'm very sensitive. You are too.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.208
We... we are alike.

01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:08.708
Shit.

01:15:09.208 --> 01:15:10.417
THANKS.

01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:12.208
I have a question...

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.333
Who is the "you"?

01:15:15.083 --> 01:15:17.083
She said, "You know."

01:15:17.833 --> 01:15:19.250
Who is she talking to?

01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:22.167
What do you think?

01:15:30.667 --> 01:15:32.458
It can't be his mother.

01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:34.750
She wouldn't tell him that.

01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:42.875
I imagine it's her inner voice.

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:48.708
It feels strange to talk
without addressing anyone.

01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:51.375
Alright.

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:53.958
Ingrid will listen to you.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.083
I'm all ears.

01:15:58.833 --> 01:15:59.958
Come here.

01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:03.125
Try standing there. We'll see.

01:16:05.292 --> 01:16:07.875
You're going to start again at...

01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:13.042
"I had some kind of breakdown."
Speak to Ingrid.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.042
Don't hesitate to touch her,

01:16:15.375 --> 01:16:17.458
that she feels you are her mother.

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:23.792
Don't forget, she never talked about it.
to no one.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.583
She is embarrassed to pray.

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:30.875
You can try to hide it,
to laugh about it, but...

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.375
You are ashamed.

01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:40.458
You are ashamed of your weakness.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.542
I had a sort of breakdown.

01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:03.500
I was still alone at home,

01:17:04.167 --> 01:17:06.708
Lying in my bed, in tears.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:13.500
It happens to everyone.
to cry in her bed...

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:23.500
Someone said that praying,
That's not talking to God.

01:17:25.167 --> 01:17:27.542
It's accepting one's despair.

01:17:28.542 --> 01:17:31.208
It's throwing yourself to the ground because...

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.292
That's all we can do.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:39.500
Like when you have a broken heart,
and that we think...

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.833
"Please, call me back.
Forgive me.

01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:46.167
Please, come back to me.

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:54.708
I had messed everything up.

01:17:57.583 --> 01:18:00.167
I was alone,

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.833
I was crying.

01:18:05.125 --> 01:18:07.708
So, for the first time

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.625
I sat down on the floor

01:18:15.083 --> 01:18:16.542
And I prayed.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:23.250
I don't know who I was talking to.
But I said it out loud:

01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:27.792
"Help me."

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:31.167
I can't take it anymore.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.208
I can't do it alone.

01:18:36.583 --> 01:18:38.250
I want to find my place.

01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:40.500
I want to find my place."

01:18:58.042 --> 01:19:00.583
If only...

01:19:00.958 --> 01:19:03.083
Her mother was just like her in the film.

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:07.625
Exactly.

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:21.792
Do you think it works in English?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.458
Yes, very good.

01:19:24.042 --> 01:19:26.125
What if I adopted a Norwegian accent?
Like Ingrid?

01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:29.750
I don't have an accent.

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:31.542
She is Swedish.

01:19:32.125 --> 01:19:33.417
Do I have an accent?

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.833
You can barely hear it. But...

01:19:36.583 --> 01:19:39.583
That's not weird
if you all have an accent,

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:41.125
Except for me?

01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:44.333
Maybe. I'll think about it.

01:19:48.208 --> 01:19:51.125
Can we talk about my character?

01:19:51.292 --> 01:19:52.458
Of course.

01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:55.292
The biggest mystery for me remains:
Why ?

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:58.083
Why did she decide to commit suicide?

01:19:59.292 --> 01:20:00.458
Yes.

01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:02.500
What do you think?

01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:09.625
She is depressed, like her mother.

01:20:11.625 --> 01:20:13.542
But she has a child.

01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:17.792
That's the question the film poses.

01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:20.583
It's up to you to find your own answer.

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:28.875
Can you tell me about your mother?

01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:33.833
Without meaning to be indiscreet,

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:36.375
I think that could be relevant.

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:39.292
This film is not about my mother.

01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:04.000
Here is his record as registered by the militia.

01:22:04.167 --> 01:22:05.667
and his file at the Grini camp.

01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:09.125
Here is the testimony of Karin Irgens.

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:11.958
as well as the rest of the file,

01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:15.083
which contains photographs

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:17.333
of reenacted torture scenes.

01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:20.875
These images are shocking.

01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:23.083
I prefer to warn you.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:27.083
This concerns her
is indicated by these adhesive butterflies.

01:22:27.583 --> 01:22:28.875
Thank you.

01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:52.000
IRGENS, Karin

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:55.500
Accusation: Anti-Nazi propaganda

01:23:33.667 --> 01:23:35.667
Trial for high treason

01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:37.792
List of documents in the file

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.208
Charges: acts of torture

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:57.667
Subject: Acts of torture

01:24:08.333 --> 01:24:12.125
...I screamed in pain

01:24:12.292 --> 01:24:15.292
He tied me to a hot stove...

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:18.250
They beat me severely.

01:24:18.542 --> 01:24:21.417
The pain persisted.

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:04.750
While recounting his day to Even,

01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:07.833
she noticed

01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:09.708
that she already knew all of that.

01:25:13.083 --> 01:25:17.083
She didn't understand.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.375
Was this his grandmother's testimony?

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.292
who described the events

01:25:24.792 --> 01:25:27.417
Or the number of victims

01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:30.500
which were in the same file?

01:25:31.625 --> 01:25:35.000
The police report of his suicide,

01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:36.833
was thin.

01:25:37.542 --> 01:25:39.375
It did not include a photo.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.542
but his father's name was there.

01:25:41.708 --> 01:25:43.750
He had not been questioned.

01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:48.167
probably because he hadn't

01:25:57.875 --> 01:26:00.542
And you pan your camera,
super smart.

01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:02.125
No, wait.

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:04.500
Look closely.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:14.667
Cut!

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.083
Watch.

01:26:18.167 --> 01:26:19.333
Funny, isn't it?

01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:27.958
Let me see.

01:26:38.333 --> 01:26:39.500
Bravo !

01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:47.667
We're going to Nora's premiere
ensemble ?

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:49.958
We could have dinner here beforehand.

01:26:51.417 --> 01:26:54.167
I will take a taxi from the office.

01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:55.875
But are you coming?

01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:57.500
Obviously.

01:27:07.833 --> 01:27:09.458
I want Erik in my film.

01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:13.833
It's perfect.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:20.208
It's a small role,
But he is central, Rachel's son.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.792
It's kind of you to offer, but...

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:29.792
I don't know if he has fiber optic internet.
to be an actor.

01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:32.958
That's why I want it.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.458
Nothing is worse than child actors
who gesticulate in front of the camera,

01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:41.375
who believe
in a musical.

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:44.250
Erik has something.

01:27:45.792 --> 01:27:47.333
Like a secret.

01:27:52.375 --> 01:27:53.833
You were shy too.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:55.958
Do you remember?

01:27:56.125 --> 01:27:57.583
But you were captivating.

01:27:58.375 --> 01:28:00.125
You should have continued.

01:28:11.042 --> 01:28:13.292
I would like
three glasses of fruit juice.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:19.625
Thank you for washing my clothes.

01:28:21.875 --> 01:28:24.250
Thank you for washing my clothes.

01:28:47.667 --> 01:28:50.375
I hardly dare close my eyes.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.292
I'm afraid to open them

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.375
and to see that you're no longer there.

01:28:57.542 --> 01:28:59.000
Let's take a break.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.083
Are you distracted?

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:15.833
I'm a little tired.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.542
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.

01:29:21.250 --> 01:29:24.417
The only mistake would be
not to listen.

01:29:27.958 --> 01:29:29.417
And take your time.

01:29:34.958 --> 01:29:35.750
All right ?

01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:39.542
Let's do it again, without the accent.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.458
Let's start again at...

01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:51.500
Previous page. At the very top.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.292
Delighted to meet you.

01:30:01.458 --> 01:30:02.500
Me too.

01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:03.833
Sorry for the wait.

01:30:04.042 --> 01:30:06.083
Thank you for taking the time to see me.

01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:07.375
That's normal.

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:23.833
Why did you turn down the role?

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:32.208
I cannot work with him.

01:30:33.417 --> 01:30:34.500
For what ?

01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:40.625
We can't seem to talk to each other.

01:30:41.417 --> 01:30:43.375
But it was you he wanted.

01:30:45.583 --> 01:30:46.667
Yes.

01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:49.625
Well, I don't know.

01:30:53.542 --> 01:30:56.333
I keep telling myself that he has...

01:30:57.417 --> 01:30:58.958
That he made a mistake.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.292
I can't...

01:31:08.583 --> 01:31:11.208
I can't figure her out.

01:31:12.542 --> 01:31:14.667
The more I work on the character,

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:17.792
The more I get lost
by trying to embody it.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.958
As if his melancholy...

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.958
took up all the space.

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:26.167
The idea is beautiful.

01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:32.167
But I don't know if that's the cause.

01:31:33.625 --> 01:31:35.667
of all his problems, or if it is...

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.625
the symptom
of a deeper suffering.

01:31:48.042 --> 01:31:51.042
I don't want to disappoint him.
Do you understand?

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.833
He's someone...

01:32:06.667 --> 01:32:08.375
difficult in life.

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:12.667
But he's an excellent director
who believes in you.

01:32:13.667 --> 01:32:15.625
It would be foolish to give up.

01:32:24.125 --> 01:32:27.000
I used to be in control of everything.

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:32.708
And when I lost control,
I liked it too.

01:32:33.292 --> 01:32:34.292
You see?

01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:39.083
I'm too old.

01:32:40.542 --> 01:32:41.750
There is barbed wire in the meadow.

01:32:42.125 --> 01:32:44.750
I am the last of the Mohicans.

01:32:45.333 --> 01:32:49.083
And the new kid
qui me balance ses moodboards.

01:32:51.208 --> 01:32:52.792
I miss Peter.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.708
But have you seen how old I look?

01:33:01.875 --> 01:33:03.625
I'm too tired, Michael.

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:07.417
What happened?
15 years ago, I was 55 years old.

01:33:12.125 --> 01:33:13.542
You might be right.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:19.417
Maybe we're too old for that.

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:25.292
and that this is our last film together.

01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:32.417
But promise me
not to give in to the spirit of the times.

01:33:33.458 --> 01:33:34.583
Promise me.

01:33:36.375 --> 01:33:37.667
This topic...

01:33:39.417 --> 01:33:42.125
You've already touched on it.

01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:46.542
But you never addressed it head-on,

01:33:47.042 --> 01:33:48.625
as you are doing now.

01:33:48.792 --> 01:33:50.958
In such a direct, personal way.

01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:55.583
Okay, it took you many years

01:33:56.208 --> 01:33:57.667
to get to this point.

01:33:59.083 --> 01:34:01.958
But you're going to make this film, damn it.

01:34:03.292 --> 01:34:05.167
And you're going to do it your way.

01:34:07.125 --> 01:34:08.333
Did you get it?

01:34:52.333 --> 01:34:53.667
- I will...
- All right.

01:35:03.792 --> 01:35:06.500
Can you loosen it a little?

01:36:51.167 --> 01:36:53.708
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, that's kind of you.

01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:55.500
- You were great.
- THANKS.

01:36:57.292 --> 01:37:00.250
- Everyone loved it.
- That's kind.

01:37:01.083 --> 01:37:03.833
We finally managed it, it was...

01:37:04.042 --> 01:37:04.958
It was good.

01:37:11.375 --> 01:37:12.333
How are you ?

01:37:13.375 --> 01:37:14.625
Yes, it's fine.

01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:18.417
You never call me back.

01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:19.708
Non.

01:37:20.875 --> 01:37:22.167
Did Dad come with you?

01:37:22.333 --> 01:37:24.500
Not that I know of.

01:37:27.292 --> 01:37:28.792
We hired a babysitter.

01:37:29.167 --> 01:37:31.417
We're going to have a drink in Tekehtopa.

01:37:31.542 --> 01:37:32.750
If you're available.

01:37:32.958 --> 01:37:34.125
Excuse me ?

01:37:34.458 --> 01:37:36.292
My sincere congratulations,

01:37:36.458 --> 01:37:38.625
What a magnificent performance!

01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:14.958
Yes, I made an appointment.

01:38:15.125 --> 01:38:16.792
I'll keep you posted.

01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:19.625
But for tonight, that's impossible.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.292
I often played when I was sick,

01:38:23.792 --> 01:38:28.500
this is the first time
that I cancel a performance.

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:30.875
I am so sorry.

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:33.792
Yes, thank you.

01:38:36.083 --> 01:38:37.167
Bye.

01:39:17.542 --> 01:39:18.958
Where is Erik?

01:39:19.583 --> 01:39:20.958
He will be back soon.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:26.292
Why didn't you come?
At Nora's premiere?

01:39:26.458 --> 01:39:28.167
She didn't want me to be there.

01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:34.958
Let's see. Here's the original version.

01:39:35.292 --> 01:39:36.875
And the English translation,

01:39:37.667 --> 01:39:39.542
so that Erik could learn his lines.

01:39:40.208 --> 01:39:42.708
If he has an accent, it doesn't matter.

01:39:43.417 --> 01:39:45.042
Are you Michael?

01:39:45.625 --> 01:39:47.708
He's going to have to miss school.

01:39:51.333 --> 01:39:52.583
I'm a little hesitant...

01:39:53.792 --> 01:39:57.292
It's going to be great. I promise you.

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:58.667
I don't know if he wants to.

01:39:58.833 --> 01:40:00.292
Yes, he wants to.

01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:01.708
How do you know?

01:40:01.875 --> 01:40:03.250
I spoke to him.

01:40:03.417 --> 01:40:04.792
Did you talk to him about it?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.708
Vaguely.

01:40:07.083 --> 01:40:08.083
He jumped for joy.

01:40:08.417 --> 01:40:10.625
Did you talk to him about it without me?

01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:20.583
When you acted in my film...

01:40:22.292 --> 01:40:25.125
I have wonderful memories of it.

01:40:26.583 --> 01:40:27.958
It's going to be great.

01:40:28.583 --> 01:40:30.583
Read the script together.

01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:31.792
Rachel will love it

01:40:32.167 --> 01:40:34.083
work on these scenes with him.

01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:36.083
They are very cheerful.

01:40:36.667 --> 01:40:38.833
She will see other aspects of the film...

01:40:39.042 --> 01:40:41.125
Stop talking. Be quiet.

01:40:42.208 --> 01:40:44.000
Erik will not be in your film.

01:40:44.167 --> 01:40:45.500
Finally, Agnes...

01:40:45.625 --> 01:40:47.792
I enjoyed filming with you, Dad.

01:40:48.167 --> 01:40:50.125
That was the most beautiful experience I've ever had.

01:40:50.292 --> 01:40:52.750
I was finally spending time with you.

01:40:53.125 --> 01:40:55.958
I had become the center of your world.

01:40:56.125 --> 01:40:58.542
And then you vanished.
I haven't seen you in a while...

01:40:58.708 --> 01:41:00.458
It was wonderful!

01:41:01.875 --> 01:41:02.792
Yes.

01:41:04.167 --> 01:41:06.042
But also incomprehensible.

01:41:06.208 --> 01:41:08.750
You blow hot and cold.

01:41:08.958 --> 01:41:11.500
At one point, we are close
And then you disappear.

01:41:11.667 --> 01:41:14.208
and someone else
is the center of your world.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:16.792
Read it.

01:41:17.125 --> 01:41:18.667
But that's not true!

01:41:18.833 --> 01:41:21.875
I don't care if it's good or not.

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:24.417
I'm thinking of Erik.

01:41:37.125 --> 01:41:38.500
Grandfather was about to leave.

01:41:43.042 --> 01:41:44.500
Are you doing well ?

01:41:44.833 --> 01:41:46.625
- GOOD.
- Glad to see you.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.542
I missed you today.

01:41:48.708 --> 01:41:50.708
- You too.
- It's true ?

01:42:00.417 --> 01:42:02.375
What do we do?
While waiting for Dad?

01:43:45.875 --> 01:43:47.958
To what do I owe this honor?

01:43:51.292 --> 01:43:52.500
How are you ?

01:43:53.667 --> 01:43:55.042
Yes, I think so.

01:43:56.708 --> 01:43:58.750
Come, I'll make you some tea.

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:17.417
- Hold.
- THANKS.

01:44:23.708 --> 01:44:26.625
You don't want to make the film anymore?

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:35.792
That's because...

01:44:39.292 --> 01:44:41.500
I don't want to let you down.

01:44:45.208 --> 01:44:48.833
I'll stay if you insist.

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.583
I don't really feel it.

01:44:56.667 --> 01:44:58.583
And I don't think you do either.

01:44:58.750 --> 01:45:00.667
Me, in this movie?

01:45:00.833 --> 01:45:02.292
Of course it does.

01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:10.458
I doubt it.

01:45:12.125 --> 01:45:15.750
You asked me
to dye my hair

01:45:15.958 --> 01:45:18.042
the same color as your daughter.

01:45:20.167 --> 01:45:24.167
And you don't really want to
to make this film in English.

01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:27.417
You also think it sounds fake?
non ?

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.958
I don't want to disappoint you.

01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:40.667
I'm sorry.

01:45:48.583 --> 01:45:51.708
It's my fault, Rachel. I'm sorry.

01:45:55.792 --> 01:45:59.000
Most of the actors
would have made the film anyway.

01:46:00.417 --> 01:46:03.208
Or they would have left their agent
announce their departure.

01:46:07.292 --> 01:46:08.667
You came in person.

01:46:13.458 --> 01:46:15.042
You are a good person.

01:46:25.875 --> 01:46:27.250
Come on...

01:46:43.875 --> 01:46:46.625
Don't take this as a failure.

01:46:47.875 --> 01:46:50.208
You are a fantastic actress, you should know that.

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:51.708
THANKS.

01:48:59.292 --> 01:49:02.125
Sorry to have dropped in here,
But you never answer.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Pardon.

01:49:13.333 --> 01:49:14.417
Are you doing well ?

01:49:19.792 --> 01:49:21.292
When you don't answer,

01:49:22.542 --> 01:49:24.958
I'm freaking out, you know that.

01:49:29.708 --> 01:49:31.500
So? Are you sick?

01:49:32.792 --> 01:49:33.958
Non.

01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:05.083
I had a fight with Dad yesterday.

01:50:08.875 --> 01:50:10.333
I was beside myself.

01:50:11.042 --> 01:50:14.167
He wants Erik to star in his film
And I refused.

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.000
But I read the script.

01:50:23.375 --> 01:50:27.042
And it's so beautiful.
Not at all what I imagined.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.625
I know you want more
to deal with him.

01:50:37.125 --> 01:50:39.083
But you have to read it.

01:50:44.542 --> 01:50:47.000
I have the feeling he's talking about you.

01:50:47.542 --> 01:50:48.792
Finally...

01:50:50.417 --> 01:50:52.500
that he wrote it for you,

01:50:52.792 --> 01:50:54.542
This is not his mother's story.

01:50:59.958 --> 01:51:00.875
Brief...

01:51:29.167 --> 01:51:32.583
Would you mind reading this passage to me?
Out loud?

01:51:33.708 --> 01:51:35.875
Don't pay attention.

01:51:36.708 --> 01:51:38.833
The writing is a bit mannered.

01:51:39.542 --> 01:51:41.042
But read it.

01:51:50.458 --> 01:51:53.667
You know, I don't believe in God at all.

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:58.208
In our country,
Religion had no place there.

01:52:01.125 --> 01:52:02.083
We were not baptized.

01:52:02.417 --> 01:52:05.125
My sister and I had done
our civil confirmation

01:52:05.292 --> 01:52:06.417
for gifts.

01:52:07.667 --> 01:52:09.958
I had a sort of breakdown.

01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:12.500
I was still alone at home,

01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:14.542
Lying in my bed, in tears.

01:52:14.708 --> 01:52:17.000
It happens to everyone.

01:52:17.708 --> 01:52:19.583
to cry in her bed...

01:52:20.167 --> 01:52:24.042
Someone said that praying,
That's not talking to God.

01:52:24.208 --> 01:52:26.750
It's accepting one's despair.

01:52:28.958 --> 01:52:33.125
It's throwing yourself to the ground
because that's all we can do.

01:52:33.667 --> 01:52:36.000
Like when, heartbroken, you think:

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:39.583
"Call me.
You need to change your mind.

01:52:40.083 --> 01:52:41.708
"Come back to me."

01:52:43.583 --> 01:52:46.250
And I had ruined everything.

01:52:46.417 --> 01:52:48.292
I was alone, I was crying.

01:52:49.667 --> 01:52:51.792
So, for the first time,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.083
I sat down and prayed.

01:52:56.667 --> 01:52:58.375
It's difficult to explain.

01:52:59.125 --> 01:53:01.500
I don't know who I was talking to.

01:53:01.625 --> 01:53:03.333
But I said it out loud:

01:53:04.042 --> 01:53:05.417
"Help me."

01:53:08.417 --> 01:53:11.292
I can't take it anymore.

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.208
I can't do it alone.

01:53:16.125 --> 01:53:18.000
I want to find my place.

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.083
I want to find my place."

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.250
You spoke to Dad...

01:54:55.792 --> 01:54:57.500
of my suicide attempt?

01:54:57.667 --> 01:54:59.083
No, of course not.

01:55:03.333 --> 01:55:06.208
I thought the same thing as you. How does he know that?

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.542
It's mixed up

01:55:14.875 --> 01:55:17.333
with his mother's stories, too.

01:55:17.708 --> 01:55:21.083
At times, it's as if
He was there for you when you were going through a rough patch.

01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.792
He wasn't there.

01:55:24.625 --> 01:55:26.250
You were the one who was there.

01:55:47.375 --> 01:55:48.875
How is that possible?

01:55:50.375 --> 01:55:53.000
You're doing so well
And me, feeling so awful.

01:55:54.292 --> 01:55:55.708
Don't say that.

01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:02.417
How did you do it?
after the childhood we had?

01:56:02.833 --> 01:56:05.125
It wasn't easy for me either.

01:56:07.125 --> 01:56:09.667
But you managed to start a family.

01:56:11.833 --> 01:56:13.375
A home.

01:56:14.083 --> 01:56:15.042
Yes.

01:56:18.333 --> 01:56:21.375
But we didn't have the same childhood.

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:24.042
I had you.

01:56:27.958 --> 01:56:30.958
You think you are incapable
to take care of others.

01:56:32.417 --> 01:56:33.625
But you were there for me

01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:37.458
when mom wasn't well.

01:56:40.333 --> 01:56:41.875
You were washing my hair.

01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:50.375
You were doing my hair.

01:56:52.292 --> 01:56:53.667
You used to take me to school.

01:56:57.458 --> 01:56:58.833
I felt safe.

01:57:28.625 --> 01:57:30.250
I love you.

01:57:34.417 --> 01:57:35.500
Me too.

01:57:36.375 --> 01:57:38.125
I love you too.

01:58:56.333 --> 01:58:57.750
Is this better?

01:58:58.833 --> 01:59:02.000
What a joy to open my eyes
such beauty!

01:59:04.625 --> 01:59:07.333
You have a beautiful smile.

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.833
I hope your boyfriend tells you that.

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:11.792
It happens to him.

01:59:12.292 --> 01:59:14.042
I've heard that before.

01:59:15.208 --> 01:59:17.500
Don't you have anything better to offer me?

01:59:17.667 --> 01:59:19.000
You champagne?

02:00:29.417 --> 02:00:30.833
Are you going to give me some biscuits?

02:00:33.708 --> 02:00:37.625
- You know...
- Omar gets biscuits every day.

02:00:37.792 --> 02:00:39.417
- All right...
- Chocolate, even.

02:00:39.542 --> 02:00:41.792
You'll eat your sandwich first.

02:00:58.500 --> 02:00:59.542
Come on.

02:01:15.125 --> 02:01:16.125
Kisses.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.458
What's wrong with you?

02:03:01.583 --> 02:03:03.250
I forgot my phone.

02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:15.042
Kisses.

02:04:31.333 --> 02:04:32.500
Cut!

02:04:34.875 --> 02:04:36.125
Perfect.

02:04:36.292 --> 02:04:38.375
That's a wrap. Next scene.
