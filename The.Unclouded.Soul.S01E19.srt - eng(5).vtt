[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.810
[Episode 19]

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.460
Could it be

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330
that the Immortal Lord has lost her power?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.110
The Immortal Lord has lost.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.710
The Realm of Mist and Void

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.520
no longer exists.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.400
We knew that once you made it out,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.000
the first thing you'd do would be
to come and settle scores with us.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.300
So we came to you instead.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.280
Now that we've all lost our powers,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.960
let's see if your bare hands

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.829
can stand against our swords.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.070
We were previously deceived by
the Dreamshard Immortal.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.710
We apologize for the offense.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.750
It was also under Dreamshard's pressure

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.410
that we tortured you, My Lord.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.680
Please understand our situation
and forgive us, My Lord.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.350
Your face has healed?

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.710
Yes.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.380
Now that you've returned to
your mortal forms,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.240
come back with me to
the capital of Tiansheng Kingdom.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.190
I will report everything
that happened here

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.230
truthfully to His Majesty.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.430
As for your punishment,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.870
that'll be His Majesty's decision.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.920
Thank you, My Lord.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.270
You may leave.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.840
Is the Immortal Lord really dead?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.810
Should I be glad...

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.430
Or should I be sad?

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.360
You are free now.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.159
Before the Immortal Lord died,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.460
did she ever ask about me?

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.860
She never once intended to take your life.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.790
Perhaps that is what
she wished to tell you.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.940
Unparalleled beauty,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.580
immortality—

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.800
all of it was nothing

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.040
but an imagined mirage.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.500
This Realm of Mist and Void

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.800
was born from
Dreamshard's illusory obsessions.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.670
Now that Dreamshard is gone,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.120
the false has all been burned away,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.630
and the real is revealed.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.810
So this is the Immortal Lord's
crystal heart?

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.770
I never expected

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.950
it would be hidden here
amidst this flower sea.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.320
You failed to find the Yuli Spring.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.720
Will His Majesty punish you?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.950
My conscience is clear.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.690
His Majesty will see the truth.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.830
Slaying the Spirit

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.050
is also a merit.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.340
That merit cannot be counted as mine.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.740
Xiao Yao was right.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.040
In terms of skill,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.010
I lost to the demons this time.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.890
But no matter what,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.909
I must not lose my integrity.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.810
You care a lot about Xiao Yao...

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.880
I mean, about what she says.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.210
Although she's usually

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.120
willful and unrestrained,

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.650
when it comes to right and wrong,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.730
she's never ambiguous.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.040
Perhaps I was too eager to avenge Tan'er,

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.220
too intent on eradicating the demons,

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.720
that I ended up losing sight of
my own principles.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.970
If even someone like you is considered
to have lost their principles,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.370
then what does that make me?

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.860
I didn't mean it that way.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.909
When Dreamshard brought you to the island,

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:40.110
you were still young.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.240
Of course you cannot

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.370
be compared to Xiao Yao,
who grew up in the martial world.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.210
This is the first time I've seen

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.960
you blush, Demon Slayer.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.590
This is also the first time

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.210
I've seen you smile.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.950
After we reach the shore,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.210
what are your plans?

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.870
I'll first go pay respects to my brother.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:36.840
Okay.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.060
Dali.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.450
The sunlight is abundant here.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.100
You can feel the vital energies

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.530
of the sun and the moon,
of heaven and earth.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.010
Cultivate diligently,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.750
and in a few decades,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.860
you'll take human form again.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.730
When that time comes,
let's be good friends again.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.500
Little Leaf.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.240
Grow well here too.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.920
One day, when you cultivate into
a towering tree,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.830
no one will dare

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.530
bully you again.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.410
What do you mean by that?

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.460
I could feel what you did to Little Leaf

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.320
on Mount Qiansui.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.920
What did I do?

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.070
I just

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.980
used it as a slingshot.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.060
And that was just to please Zixiu.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.960
As the mighty Demon Lord,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.150
how can you be so petty?

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.440
-You're really petty.
-Alright, alright.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.500
So sharp-tongued.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.550
I can never win an argument with you.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.360
Hungry, huh?

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.750
I'll make you some noodles.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.630
How could you be so careless?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.040
It's nothing.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.870
Go rest over there.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.000
You've just barely recovered
from your serious injury.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.390
Don't worry.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.250
I know how to chop vegetables now.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.600
How about you go wait outside?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.000
It's too cramped in here.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.000
I could use more space.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.550
Come on, take this.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.150
Take this.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.510
This bowl of noodles
may not be the most delicious,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.380
but I made it with my own hands,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.840
so you must finish it all.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.310
What's wrong?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.420
It's hot.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.790
Put it down!

of spiritual power.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.380
What is the origin of
this Heart-Burning Incantation,

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.240
and is there a way to counter it?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.820
This incantation is a forbidden technique.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.880
In the demon realm,
no one has ever used it.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.300
I only heard that
when the Primordial Heavenly Mother

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.010
was mending the heavens, she violated
the natural laws of heaven and earth,

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.750
and afterward took her own life
with the Heart-Burning Incantation.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.690
Since then, throughout the Three Realms,

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.890
no one has known of it,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.050
leaving only the legend of the Sky Stone.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.440
The Sky Stone?

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.720
Yes.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.120
The Sky Stone

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.320
possesses some mysterious power,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.760
but no one has ever truly seen it.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:26.910
Don't worry.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.430
There must be a solution.

take good care of yourself

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.390
and eat properly.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.030
Okay.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.070
Here, let me feed you.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.490
It's really delicious.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.910
Humans,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.320
and demons alike,

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.490
will always face setbacks,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.150
but there's no hurdle
that can't be overcome.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.480
If your grief truly makes you
want to give up,

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.010

And 100 years later,

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.960
I've become like this,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.870
without knowing when I can recover.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.360
I just feel that

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.360
I've failed the people of
the Demons' Valley

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.910

you're a good demon—

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.440
and more than that,
you're an excellent Demon Lord.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.260
Losing your powers

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.410

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.830
Humans,

in order to observe the movements
of the sun, moon, and stars,

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.530

Azure Dragon of the East,

White Tiger of the West,

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.960
Vermilion Bird of the South,

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.760
and Black Tortoise of the North.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.270
And each of these mansions

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.030
also has its own specific name.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.070

Heart, the "Yin" Fox.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.510
That one?

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.480
Yes.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.810
I only recognize the Big Dipper,

which I use to navigate at night.

In my spare time from cultivation,

I'd go to the human realm

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.350
and pick up some ancient books to read

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.400
to pass the time.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.890
That's wonderful.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.680
All my life,

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.680
I've only read a few story books,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.030
all about talented scholars
and beautiful ladies.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.030
The characters in those stories

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.440
never worried about food or clothing

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.310
and just focused on romance.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.170
Meanwhile,

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.480
I was starving

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.590
while reading about
their romantic affairs.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.480
The more I read those books,
the angrier I became.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.680
So eventually, I stopped reading them.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.040
Let me take over.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.830

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.120

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:47.980

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.550

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.480
Good morning.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.440
Let me get you a fresh breakfast.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.510
Have a try.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.890
How is it?

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:27.490
Mmm,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.810
very fresh.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.780
I used to think

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.910
that fish could only be eaten cooked.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.400
But once, my father and I

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.100
were captured by pirates.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.240
Seeing them eat fish like that,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.550
I realized that fish could actually

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.240
be eaten this way.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.070
And then?

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.140
Then

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.220
I befriended those pirates.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.070
I even learned some

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.960
survival rules for the sea from them.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.920
For example,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.450

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.240
you were also like this.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.950
Nothing could stump you.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.490
It's different.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.880
There are far more good stuff
in Demons' Valley

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.990
than they ever had.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.640
And you're far more difficult to deal with
than they were.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.340
However,

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.720
you're much more handsome than they were.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.050

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.240
That mountain demon goes out
to eat people during the day

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.030
and returns to the courtyard at night
for cultivation.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.960
It's been dwelling here for years.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.360
Alright.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.400
Listen.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.440
Two of you, guard the front
and back doors.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.300
The rest of you,

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.150
come in with me

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.830
and set up the Eight Yang Formation.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.470
Qin Ge,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.660
you guard the front door.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.110
Yes.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.730
Bingzhu,

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.980
you guard this door.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.400
Got it.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.690
If the mountain demon returns early,

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.550
warn us at once.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.320
Understood.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.360
Let's go.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.800
Demons...

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.350
They're all demons...

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.250
Commander!

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.680
They're all demons!

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.240
Lu!

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.930
Lu!

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.680
Lu...

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.430
Lu, these are our comrades
we spend every day with.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.650
How could you bring yourself to do this?

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:18.820
Tan'er!

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.500
It's useless.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.190
My heart is long gone.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.660
You beast!

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.520
You're actually a demon!

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.030
Truly, when brother and sister
work together,

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.110
there's nothing they cannot achieve.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.920
Bingzhu,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.270
you have a great sister.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.480
Lu Tong.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.420
You once told me

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.860
that you also have a kind sister,

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.590
and you only joined the Feiyu Guards

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:16.120
to avenge her!

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.790
Why are you willing to become a demon now?

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.830
My sister is still alive.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
She fell into Spirit's hands.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.430
I promised to work for Spirit

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.450
and give her 100 young girls

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.540
in exchange for Pianpian's freedom.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.210
To trade 100 innocent lives

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.950
for your sister's freedom—

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.720
do you think she would want that?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.930
Pianpian doesn't know about this.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.960
Spirit took my heart

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.420
and replaced it with a stone.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.050
She said that from then on,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.660
I would be free of desires

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.750
and invincible.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.400
Yet, I still failed.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.000
I was defeated by you siblings.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.640
Take my stone heart

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.830
and present it as your achievement.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.880
Bingzhu.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.850
If you ever meet Pianpian,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.470
please take good care of her for me.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.550
I've never given up on saving her.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.490
Ten people went out,

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.550
and only one rookie came back.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.949
Not only have we suffered heavy losses,

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:11.949
but you didn't catch a single demon.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.420
Why did you even come back?

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.710
My Lord.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.780
Actually, I didn't come back empty-handed.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.590
Good.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.920
At least we have something
to report to His Majesty.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.590
Your entire team, except for you,

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.510
is dead,

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.300
but we can't afford to lose
the salary allocated per head

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.500
from the higher-ups.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:05.970
Here's what we'll do:

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.660
quickly replenish your team.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.920
From now on,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.520
you'll be the captain of this team.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.130
Are you the only one

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.230
who knows about this?

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.940
All our men who died that day

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.170
are buried here.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.480
Thank you for preserving

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.470
my brother's honor.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.240
Where are you going?

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.660
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.770
I'm about to enter the palace
to see His Majesty.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.610
Since I've failed His Majesty's trust
on this journey,

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.180
this palace visit

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.910
may end in my demise.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.690
This is the key to my house,

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.360
and all the savings I've accumulated
over the years

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.220
are hidden at the southeast corner
of my courtyard.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.400
Go wait for me at my house.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.110
If I still haven't returned

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.550
by 11 PM,

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.190
take the money

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.300
and leave as fast as you can.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.500
As for Lu's entrustment,

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.030
this is all I can do.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.350
Do you really have to go?

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.160
I must stay true to my principles.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.800
I've always had nowhere to go.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.660
Whether in the human realm

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.270
or in the Realm of Mist and Void,
it's all the same.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.320
If you must follow your principles,

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.480
then I'll guard your house

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.110
and wait for your return.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.610
If I truly can't make it back,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.750
I have to trouble you

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.710
to take care of Tan'er for me.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040
Please talk to her

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.160
and try to get her to
let go of her obsessions

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.360
and enter the cycle of reincarnation
as soon as possible.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.350
I, the guilty subject Bingzhu,

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.150
have failed Your Majesty's grace!

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.150
I await Your Majesty's punishment!

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.580
Guilty subject Bingzhu.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.170
You were tasked with
eliminating demons for the people,

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.070
yet you secretly harbored evil beings,

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.930
allowing them to harm the people.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.960
You deceived for fame

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.560
and harmed your colleagues.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.070
His Majesty will surely
examine this matter thoroughly

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.330
and spare no leniency.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.380
The guilty subject Bingzhu will now be

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.330
thrown into the Imperial Prison

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.190
and executed on an appointed day!

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.070
Though I have failed in my duties,

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.880
there are reasons for what happened!

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.400
I only request to see His Majesty

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.130
so I could apologize in person!

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.110
Apologize?

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.960
His Majesty only wants the Yuli Spring,

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.360
not your apologies.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.120
After extensive searching,
the Feiyu Guards

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.080
have obtained the spring water
from Mount Tianyu.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.980
His Majesty is currently
taking it for his health

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:44.000
and has no time to care about
your excuses.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.320
The Kunlun Mirror is not yet complete.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.800
How could you have obtained
the Yuli Spring?

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.190
You dare to present fake spring water
as a tribute?

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.150
Ji Yan,

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.210
you are deceiving His Majesty!

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.800
Deceiving me?

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.510
But it seems to me that
the one deceiving me is you, Bingzhu.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.400
Your Majesty!

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.320
Do you recognize this person?

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.260
Of course we do.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.440
Your Majesty,

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.840
the one who harmed us

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.030
is exactly this Bingzhu.
