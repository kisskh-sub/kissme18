WEBVTT

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.799
This one

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:39.439
Or this one

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.520
This one

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.439
Alright

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.039
This is it

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:48.799
I'm counting on you today

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:55.960
Miss Qixing

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.719
I've made plans with Xin Tong

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.320
After tonight

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.079
You

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.399
will be the heir to Four Seas

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.079
Good

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.480
Tonight will be spectacular

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.959
I've already promised Lin Xiang

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.280
to attend the banquet as his girlfriend

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.280
Then we'll accompany him

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:12.920
in putting on a good show

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.640
Has your dance partner arrived?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.640
Should be soon

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.239
Being your dance partner

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.359
is quite fortunate

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.519
Sorry

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.319
I'm late

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.280
You look beautiful today

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.040
Thank you

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.680
Let me introduce you to my parents

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.120
Mom, Dad

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.560
This is my friend

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.120
Xin Tong

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.599
Hello, Uncle and Auntie

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.680
Miss Xin

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.040
What does your family do?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.239
I...

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.359
I don't have a family

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.451
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.359
How can you not have a family?

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:01.719
I grew up in an orphanage

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.959
How pitiful

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.879
You must have suffered a lot

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.319
However

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.000
Children raised in such an environment

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.240
are very good at assessing situations

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.000
and finding a big tree to lean on

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.639
Mom

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.280
I have to say

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.960
you have good taste

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.599
in targeting our Lin Xiang

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.479
That's enough

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.719
Let me introduce you to some other friends

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.960
President Wen

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.759
Let me introduce you two

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.960
This is Xin Tong

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.080
My girlfriend

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.759
Hello, Uncle and Auntie

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.080
Good

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.919
By the way

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.479
Look at my memory

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.479
Xin Tong is your Four Seas employee

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.919
You must have met her, right?

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.319
I seem to have some impression

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.960
You are...

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.879
Which department?

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.319
Chairman

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.039
I'm from Marketing and Operations

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.439
People from Operations

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.000
seem to be

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.439
all-rounders

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.800
Right?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.840
Xin Tong is my junior

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.719
The two of us

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.159
could be called childhood sweethearts

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.479
Childhood sweethearts

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.840
Old Lin

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.960
Look at this

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.800
A talented man

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.360
and a beautiful woman

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.439
Your Lin family

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.319
is truly blessed

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.479
You flatter us

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.439
I heard Young Master Wen

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.639
is also about to get engaged

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.919
This means we have

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.159
double happiness arriving

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.199
Dad

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.680
Mom

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.000
Here we are

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.280
Let me introduce you

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.919
This is my daughter

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.759
Qixing

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.919
Hello, Uncle and Auntie

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.000
Before this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.159
we never imagined

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.520
the big influencer Qixing

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.960
was the Wen family's daughter

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.199
Lin Xiang was the one who told us

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.879
Xin Tong

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.439
No, no

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.360
You should call her sister-in-law

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.159
Where's my brother?

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.879
Wait a minute

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.439
Sister-in-law?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.360
What's going on?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.599
Qixing

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.280
When did you

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.759
start calling Lin Xiang 'brother'?

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.319
Calling him...

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.280
What are you talking about?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.479
You didn't come with my brother?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.120
Dad

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.960
Where's Wen Pei'an?

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.439
He'll be here soon

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.000
Xin Tong

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.479
What does 'sister-in-law' mean?

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.719
You...

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.120
Let me explain to you later

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.800
Lin Xiang

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:19.959
Xin Tong didn't tell you, did she?

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.000
She and my brother are about to get married

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.079
Xin Tong

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.000
Is there something you're hiding from me?

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.480
Senior

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.399
Listen, let me explain

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.079
Wen Pei'an and I are just fake lovers

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.279
Sorry, everyone

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.199
I'm late to the event

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.199
Brother

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.720
You'll really stop at nothing

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.959
for the inheritance, won't you?

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.000
What do you mean by that?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.000
Dad

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.040
I really can't stand it anymore

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.519
Wen Pei'an has been deceiving you all along

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.000
This is his relationship contract with Xin Tong

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.959
I will spare no effort

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.439
to push you to the position of Four Seas' heir.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.600
Even if it means becoming

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.720
a live-in son-in-law of the Wen family.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.079
Happy cooperation.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.120
Not only that,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.680
Wen Pei'an,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.120
while in charge of Four Seas,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.839
allowed huge management loopholes to appear.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.399
Qixing,

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.959
why are you doing this?

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.319
I agree with your point of view.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.720
We are born to be treated unequally.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.439
But I am different from you.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.680
You are still trapped in their rules,

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:50.079
while I

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.040
want to create my own rules.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.959
Xin Tong,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.399
you actually sold yourself for money

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.000
to sign this bottomless Relationship Contract.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.160
How is this different from sex work?

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.800
You have really disappointed me greatly.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.360
I am so disappointed.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.680
Dad,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.839
I'm sorry.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.199
I was the one who dragged Xin Tong into this.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.040
It is all my fault.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.079
This has nothing to do with her.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.519
Stop blaming her, all of you.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.120
As for that contract,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.920
it was I, as the President,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.199
who forced her to sign it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.560
Senior...

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.279
why are you treating me like this?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.079
Gold digger!

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.319
Let go of my son!

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.480
Enough!

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.879
This farce should end.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.240
It is time for it to end.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:42.519
Xin Tong,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.639
you need to open your eyes

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.160
and take a good look at this

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.079
sanctimonious Four Seas heir beside you.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.839
In order to deal with me,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.680
he has been using you all along.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800
For this event,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.680
we must make Qixing stumble.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.680
Mobilize all available resources.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.079
Don't worry,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.800
I will arrange it.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.959
I can prove

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.959
that the data fraud in this livestream event

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.959
and the skyrocketing return rate

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.199
were caused by Wen Pei'an

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.519
and Xin Tong single-handedly.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.759
The goal was to make Qixing back off

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.439
and leave Four Seas.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.879
You didn't expect this, did you?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.120
Your wishful thinking

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.759
has fallen through with me again.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.079
So what?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560
Is there any other evidence?

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:26.480
Just based on a recording and a word from my assistant,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.439
what can you do?

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.959
Bring me down?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.199
Lin Xiang,

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.399
you are just a hopeless case.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.240
A hopeless case.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.399
Our Lin family,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.800
as a supplier for Four Seas Group for ten years...

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.000
President Wen,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.519
I really cannot bear to see

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.399
Four Seas Group

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.759
be destroyed in Wen Pei'an's hands like this.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:00.920
I have a hard drive here.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:04.160
It contains the chain of evidence for the Lin family's

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.079
data fraud in this livestream event.

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:07.600
Not only that,

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.839
in order to prove that he

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.639
can be a qualified heir,

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.439
for the past six months,

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.040
all livestream activities

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.040
have involved data fraud.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.600
President Wen, please take a look.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.839
It is all faked.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.319
Since he dares to fake data,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.360
Exactly.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.799
The Lin Group

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.200
has wanted to expand online business for years.

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:48.480
Lin Xiang happens to be in charge of this area.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:49.879
So for all these years,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.559
he has been framing Four Seas openly and secretly without limits.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.240
Our livestream data fraud this time

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.519
is inextricably linked to him.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.799
So,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.559
what we lack now

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.039
is the evidence of data fraud.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:03.000
That's right.

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:06.240
We need to get the Lin family's fake data.

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:13.080
Then do you have a plan for calling me here?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:14.879
I want to

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.639
use Baiting.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840
Baiting?

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:17.960
What will you use as bait?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.519
You.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.240
The plan is this.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.679
I, Lin Xiang, dare to speak up today

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.720
on behalf of all suppliers of Four Seas Group

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.080
to sincerely offer you a suggestion.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.399
We unanimously believe

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.679
that Miss Qixing

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.559
is the most suitable heir

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.360
for the future of Four Seas Group.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:45.279
Xin Tong,

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:46.879
as long as you are willing,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.799
the doors of the Lin Group

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.759
will always be open to you.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.759
This is the last time I'll call you Senior.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.840
That's right.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.879
You were the white moonlight of my youth.

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.159
However,

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:03.320
that was just a fantasy.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.720
Now I see the truth.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.799
I also know

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.080
that white moonlight

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:10.279
is just the sun's reflection.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.840
And the moon's surface

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:13.960
is pockmarked

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.919
and scarred,

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.639
just like your current face.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.360
It disgusts me.

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:19.960
Lin Xiang,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.840
Have I not told you yet

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.919
that I've long been the heir to Four Seas Group?

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.879
Our Four Seas Group now

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:29.399
operates under a Co-CEO system.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:32.840
What do you mean?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.679
What do I mean?

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.960
I have a recording here

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:37.679
that might be more interesting.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.399
I can help you publicly expose

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:45.120
Wen Pei'an and Xin Tong's fake relationship.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.240
Make your parents lose face.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.759
Guaranteed to overwhelm Wen Pei'an.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.000
We can also use

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.840
this live-stream incident to frame him.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.519
But you must promise me,

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.399
after you successfully enter Four Seas,

00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:58.200
you'll use your authority

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.200
to help me cover up

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.519
the data fraud from this impromptu event.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.799
But I'm curious.

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:06.840
Do you really not care about Xin Tong's feelings?

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.360
Don't you think

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.399
for someone of my background,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.440
women of her class

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:16.480
are just dolls on a shelf?

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:18.960
Whoever bids highest gets her.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.519
Besides, I've never lacked for toys since childhood.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:24.720
Furthermore,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.399
for a man to rise to power,

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:29.480
he must always sacrifice a few women first.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.679
Tonight's banquet

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:33.519
is our Treacherous Banquet for you.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.639
The data from the USB drive has been given to the authorities.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.399
Now we have ironclad proof of your fraud.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.960
Alright.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.320
That's enough.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.759
Chairman Lin,

00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:47.200
regarding this matter,

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:49.159
I don't intend to pursue it further.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.960
But your son

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:53.279
almost destroyed your Lin family

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.960
and my Four Seas' decades of legacy.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.120
You should discipline him properly.

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.279
Lin Xiang,

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.639
you've brought great shame to the Lin family.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.759
Dad,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.600
everything I did

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.799
was for the sake of the Lin Group.

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.399
I don't want to be

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.879
the son who disappoints you anymore.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:15.559
Stop embarrassing yourself here.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:17.879
Dad!

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:19.360
Mom!

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.000
Dad!

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.320
Mom!

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.039
This...

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:26.399
The act is over already?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.759
I...

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:29.320
I haven't had enough fun yet.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.559
Then what do you want to do?

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:31.720
I should be...

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.559
You've disappointed me so much.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:36.240
Brother,

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:37.320
do you have a plan?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.320
Since everyone loves acting so much,

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:42.559
why don't we put on a good show?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.679
Wait, wait!

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.759
Putting on a show?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.039
How can you leave your old man out?

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.399
Qixing,

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:52.399
you play the villain.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.080
Alright.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.679
Xin Tong...

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:57.919
No,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.720
I should call you Sister-in-law.

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:00.919
Sister-in-law.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.639
Where's my brother?

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:05.600
Qixing!

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.519
You...

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:09.399
You...

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.320
Dad!

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.039
This is their

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:17.759
Relationship Contract.

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:25.159
Qixing,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.360
I don't understand.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.360
Why did you have to do this?

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:30.919
Dear Xin Tong,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.759
I didn't mean to hurt you.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.159
But I believe

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.399
we are from different worlds.

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:37.600
You're still trapped

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.120
in the rules they created,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.600
while I, Qixing,

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:42.720
must rely on my own strength

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.679
to change my fate.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.200
You've disappointed me so much.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.200
No, no.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.519
Not forceful enough.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.039
Let me try again.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.399
You've disappointed me so much!

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:05.759
Lin Xiang's work ability

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:07.759
has never been recognized by his father.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.639
Plus, he's very jealous of my brother.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.480
People like him fear having their pride wounded most.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.879
We can deliberately provoke him

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:15.120
and use that as a breakthrough

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:16.639
to make him reveal

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:17.960
the evidence of data fraud himself.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.159
I never trample on others' dignity.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.480
What evidence do you have?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Just based on a recording

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.399
and a word from my assistant?

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.759
Isn't that too childish?

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:35.200
Lin Xiang,

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:37.840
You are just a

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:39.960
hopeless

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:41.240
case.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.240
Was that forceful enough?
