WEBVTT

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.240
Brazen thug

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.680
Talking nonsense

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.240
I am a Descendant of the Ma family

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.280
a True Celestial Master

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.520
I... you, you, you, you, you - what are you?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920
Li Ergou

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.760
from Li Family Village in Hong Kong, China.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.560
How many times were you arrested for feudal superstition?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.480
Do you still want to be arrested?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.560
Y-you... what are you saying?

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560
I don't understand

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.840
You won't listen to reason

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.680
A Qiang, call the police

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.920
He is a fiend

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.920
Find someone more capable

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.120
Hey, Master, Master!

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.480
No, sir

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.320
Can't you tell he's a fraud?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760
You guys aren't scammers, right?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.320
Of course we're not

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.080
Sir

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.120
I am Zheng Nanfeng, a manager at Yida Real Estate

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.560
Ah, right

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.360
Also a swindler

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.680
You...

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.960
Sir, we came today

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.160
to ask you to consent to the relocation

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.760
But we didn't expect

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.520
our competitors also sent people

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.720
I will pay for anything broken today

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.960
You really are all scammers

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.200
Get out

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240
All of you, scram

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.280
Let's go

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.880
Oh, right, sir

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.360
You look pretty robust to me

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.040
You are destined to live to a hundred

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.320
It's just that you're overworked

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.160
Try not to overthink from now on

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920
To be honest with you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.360
My son works away from home all year

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.160
He doesn't come back even once a year to see me

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.960
I am just a lonely old man

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.120
With no one to talk to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.160
Sir

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.160
Young people, you know

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.920
all want to go out into the world and make their way

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.560
I believe

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.000
your son is waiting till he earns enough money

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.120
then come back to take good care of you

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.560
Alright

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.720
Then we won't sign

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.120
We are leaving

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.040
Take care of your health, sir

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.560
Take care of yourself

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.640
Wait

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.360
I will sign

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.080
As for this contract

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.960
I have read it all

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
There is no issue

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.160
Manager Zheng is a good man

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.160
Entrust the village to him

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.440
This old man is reassured

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.560
You all should sign as well

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520
Oh

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.080
Mr. Zheng is really impressive

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.200
The master I hired

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.320
You dealt with him so fast

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.680
But I think this contract

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.720
still cannot be signed

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.280
Xie Xun

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.560
It has come to a critical point

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.760
and you are still picking a fight

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.680
Rong

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.560
Rong

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.080
Uncle Miao

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.920
I heard your wife's grave

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.040
is in the neighboring Liu Cun

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.120
Ah

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480
I have already bought that land in Liu Cun

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.160
If you sign this

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.560
later I might “accidentally” move her grave

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.840
So do not blame me then

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.840
Ah

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.840
My wife

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.240
Sigh, sigh, sigh

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.000
Please, please do not touch my wife's grave

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960
Please, sir, I beg you

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.960
Calm down, calm down

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.840
Calm down

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.520
Calm down, calm down

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.320
Calm down, calm down

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.280
Calm down, calm down

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.600
I am not signing

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.040
Hey, hey, sir

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.040
Do not get worked up, do not get worked up

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840
I am not signing

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.360
Uncle Miao

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.280
My wife suffered with me her whole life

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.840
Only at the end we found this Auspicious Feng Shui Land

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.720
If you dig up her grave

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.960
then she will never rest in peace

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.080
I am not signing, not signing

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.960
A bet is a bet

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.120
The Dongyang Xincun lot is Xie Rong's now

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.280
Many thanks, Master Qin

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.760
I did not expect a woman to be this vicious

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.320
Even worse than your brother

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.120
Zheng Nanfeng

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.120
You are no different, acting like a fake mystic

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.960
Luckily, I, a mere woman,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960
have thought up a countermeasure

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320
or your fake-master scheme would have worked

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.520
Alright, that is how it is

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.160
Since the Dongyang Xincun plot

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.240
has been given to Xie Rong

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.720
then the Xiliu Tang lot goes to you

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Thank you, Master Qin

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.560
Businessmen are profit-driven by nature

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.080
So, Business is business

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.160
No matter which of you develops these two lots

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.240
the price

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.440
must be doubled

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.160
No problem, Master Qin

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.240
Master Qin, the Dongyang Xincun plot is good

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.760
Even doubling it is fine

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.960
Xiliu Tang has no village or shops around

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.480
There are no supporting facilities

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.160
And you still want it doubled

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.080
How can we do this

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.520
Whatever Master Qin says, that is the price

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.960
Looks like to enter real estate

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.480
there is no other way left

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.960
I say it will not work

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.680
No matter how you calculate it

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.560
cost per square meter is at least 1,300 to 1,400

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.960
if we do not cut corners

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.720
The Xiliu Tang project is destined to lose heavily

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760
If we want to make money

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.640
we must set the price at 1,500 or above per sq m

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.560
What are you thinking

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.560
Haicheng's priciest is only 1,200 per sq m

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.520
Ordinary flats are just eight or nine hundred

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.440
Nanfeng, what do you think

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.760
You cannot come in

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.560
You cannot come in

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.280
Oh

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360
You are all here

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.520
You must be worried, right

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.160
Mr. Zheng and his people forced their way in

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.360
I could not stop them

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.640
What are you here for

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.280
We have known each other so long

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.200
I have never paid your company a visit

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.960
Your company has just opened

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.160
I should at least bring you a gift

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.600
Giving a clock

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.440
Do you want us to die early or what?

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.360
Hey

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.720
It's not what I want

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.360
That's just the reality

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.760
Land in Xiliu Tang has doubled in price

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.320
Your cost to build

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.360
Is higher than Haicheng's priciest homes

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.640
No profit, of course you'll send a clock

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.720
How do you know we won't make money?

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.960
How will you make money?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.760
With my mouth

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.480
At 1,500 per square meter, I profit

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.880
The priciest home in Haicheng is 1,200 now

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.160
You can sell for 1,500?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.760
Mr. Xie

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.240
I made a bet with your brother

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.680
Today I want to make a bet with you

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.080
We at Yida Real Estate won't just make money,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.920
We'll make enough to bankrupt you

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.480
Do you believe that?

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.240
Zheng Nanfeng, sometimes I really admire you

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.160
Admire your blind confidence

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.440
They say confident people have good luck

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.040
Leave this clock here for now

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.360
When you go under, I'll deliver it to you

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.280
Okay

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.760
Let's see who this clock ends up with

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.960
Let's go

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.640
Why stare like that? Is there something on my face?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.640
Why do I feel

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.240
The way Xie Rong looks at you

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.320
is a bit weird

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.560
Is it?

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.360
We were just fretting about building

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.760
Then you turned and bragged hard to Xie Rong

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.360
What on earth are you thinking?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.760
Why are you so nervous?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.880
Have my words ever failed to come true?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.960
What trick do you have now?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.520
Still keeping us in suspense

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.760
Top price is a little over one thousand

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.720
Then I say I'll sell at 1,500

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.520
Doesn't that mean profit?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.480
Layouts then had no Bright living room and bathroom

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.120
There was no such concept

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.240
We'll make it residential housing

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.040
Then flip it around

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.960
Next-generation homes

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.960
Turnkey delivery

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.160
Even I feel tempted hearing this

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.960
Though I can't tell what he's saying,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.480
I still think it can work

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.120
When we hand over the homes,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280
as employee benefits,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.120
everyone gets one unit

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360
Really, really

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.160
Really

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.520
Thanks, Brother Feng

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.160
Okay, okay, okay

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.160
Come, come, come, come, come

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.360
Next Monday,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.680
Xiliu Tang village holds a relocation meeting

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.240
Relocation

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.120
Meeting

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.440
Still not asleep this late?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.480
Got something on your mind?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.760
Nanfeng, let me ask you

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.040
Your plan is good, sure,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.680
but there's a key problem

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.160
How do you plan to solve it?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.760
Funding, right?

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.720
Given the scale of our plot,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.280
Banks won't release full loans

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.160
for relocation

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.280
I've considered that

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.760
I'll find another way

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.240
What do you mean?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.280
These are the title deeds for the villa and dance hall

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.840
I plan to pledge the houses to fund the company

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.760
No

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.760
The hall and the house are your safeguard

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.040
The company can go under

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.960
The house you keep in reserve can't be touched

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.360
If the company goes under,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.080
A Ming, A Qiang, and so many in the company

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.760
would all lose their jobs

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.960
What would they do?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.040
Besides,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.920
Are you willing to lose to Xie Rong?

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.560
Give me a bit more time

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.560
I'll think of a way

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.200
Alright,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.680
You hold the title deed for now

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.680
Use it or not, how to use it—your call

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.520
Sis Zhiyi, Xu Rumeng's been absent five days

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.280
I called Shengang, no one picks up

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.760
Could Xie Rong and his guys have taken her?

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.040
That woman is playing dirty again

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.480
Come on, let's go find her

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.360
Sis

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.760
Where have you been these days?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.720
It’s not Rumeng

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.920
Where have you been these past few days?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.320
We were just about to go out to find you

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.680
We all thought Xie Rong kidnapped you again

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.760
Asking around everywhere

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.560
So you were all this worried about me

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.760
Looks like this trip wasn’t for nothing

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.240
You still have the nerve to laugh

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.120
Look how you had the three of us panicking

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.960
Since you were so anxious,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.560
I’ll give you a reward

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.160
This is one million

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.160
Not you

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.160
Where did you get so much money?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.960
Don’t worry about that

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.920
Just take it and use it for the company

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.160
If you won’t tell me where this money came from,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.760
I refuse to use it

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.920
I took it out as a bank loan

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.760
For the loan, what did you use as collateral?

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.880
Banks over in Hong Kong, China are more developed

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.560
I told them about our project

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.360
They readily gave me the loan

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.320
That simple?

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.760
Just that simple

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.160
We didn’t say it was from the family

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.320
Otherwise they would never accept it

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.880
Then for the loan you should also

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880
discuss it with us

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.680
Alright, Rumeng did it for everyone

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.960
Let’s leave it at that for now

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.000
We’re all one family

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.480
It’s only right we shoulder things together

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.560
Alright, alright

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.560
Next time there’s something,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.720
I’ll definitely tell you in advance

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.640
Okay?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.600
Okay

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.440
The funds are in place

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.960
Next, it’s your home turf

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.480
Have you decided how to spend it?

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.560
Ah

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.280
This money,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.440
we need to spend it in parts

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.560
I miss you

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.480
Whenever dusk arrives

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.360
The evening breeze rises

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.200
I miss you

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.200
Life’s answer

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.320
Try not to see it clearly

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.720
Close your eyes

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.920
Don’t respond

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.920
The evening wind blows and blows

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.600
Go with the wind

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.040
Tonight, children, don’t cry in secret

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.200
Don’t cry in secret

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.040
The evening wind blows and blows

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.720
Go with the wind

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.880
As night falls with stars

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.880
Gently drift to sleep

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.320
Catch the evening breeze
