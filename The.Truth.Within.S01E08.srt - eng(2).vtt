00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.300
Fei.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.410
Hold on.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.850
Go.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.410
No.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.820
No!

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.460
Go.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.820
Go.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.410
Chen,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.450
why did you decide

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.170
to open a clinic in He City?

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.250
Then why did you

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.370
transfer to He City?

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.540
You know why.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.220
I know you

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.980
don't want to forgive Li Ming.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.140
But no matter what,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.930
he was once

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.460
our good friend.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.780
Come on. Cheers.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.140
Cheers.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.020
Congratulations!

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.850
Cheers!

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.700
Congratulations.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.370
Thanks, Chen!

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.050
Thanks, Chen!

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.730
Qi!

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.930
Are you really going to be a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.250
medical examiner after you graduate?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.580
Yes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.580
I still hope

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.810
to uncover the truth

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.100
for the deceased.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.580
Come on.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.100
I don't know what he was thinking.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.100
Why do you like

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.410
dealing with dead people?

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.250
Can't you be like me?

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.660
Studying for my master's
degree while doing research.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.660
Let me tell you,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.900
Jiang City Medical University

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.460
is currently developing a new drug.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.340
If they succeed,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.660
it can save

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.580
many people.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.170
You have ambitions

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.050
and dreams.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.100
Come on,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.490
for your dreams.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.490
Cheers.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.930
For dreams.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.290
Cheers to dreams!

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.020
Cheers!

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.700
Cheers!

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.930
Friends?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.140
If he considered us friends,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.370
he wouldn't have done that.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.220
People

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.340
change.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.660
He would.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.460
You would.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.170
I would too.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.850
He just forgot his initial

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.460
dream of saving people

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.370
and embarked on a path of no return.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.460
But that was his choice.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.540
It wasn't our fault, okay?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.930
But Fei died because of him.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.980
Do you know

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.490
what kind of patient I fear most

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.490
in all my years

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.610
as a psychologist?

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.050
It's the kind of people who know

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.580
that they refuse to wake up,

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.540
yet stubbornly refuse

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.020
to believe it.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.980
Mr. Qi!

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.100
The results of the drug components

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.930
in Li Yiqi

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:49.850
and Li Shuting are out.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.140
The drug composition in their bodies

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.980
doesn't match.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.900
Hello?

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.490
The results are out.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.820
Mr. Wu.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.650
Where is Mrs. Wu?

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.370
She went on a trip abroad

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.220
with her friends.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.890
She just called.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:43.980
She was glad you

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.010
remembered my birthday.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:45.940
So she won't

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.220
feel so guilty

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.850
leaving me

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.130
alone at home.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.650
Sizhe.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.420
How are you recovering?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.730
I'm fully recovered.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.490
Thanks for your concern.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.010
I've been wanting to visit you.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.340
But...

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.250
Mr. Wu,

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.700
please don't say that.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.980
It's not convenient for you

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.850
to get involved in Li Ming's matter.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.730
He's almost drunk but
still wants to drink.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.530
I'll get him another bottle.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.890
Mr. Wu.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.180
I used to celebrate my birthday

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.420
with the three of you.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.250
But Li Ming is not here.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.460
Li Ming has

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.730
disappointed me so much.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.250
Even if he gave his life,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.650
he couldn't get your girlfriend back.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.650
How could I have

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.770
taught such a student?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.060
Mr. Wu,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.370
is it possible

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.460
that the drug formula Li Ming

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.820
prepared back then leaked?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.340
It leaked out?

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.850
That shouldn't be possible.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.460
Everyone

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.180
in the lab back then,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.130
including me,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.100
was investigated.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.460
Everyone

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.580
was surprised.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.180
We knew

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.220
he was busy every day.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.700
No one expected him to be busy with this.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.730
If that's the case,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.250
then you need to investigate it.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.460
It's better to find out the truth.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.060
Mr. Wu.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.770
You think I should investigate?

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.100
I've watched you grow up.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.940
I know you too well.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.490
As long as you have doubts,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.980
even if I don't support you,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.490
you'll still investigate.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.340
So, do it.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.250
Investigate.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.060
Only by trying your best

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.340
will you know if you're

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.530
doing the right thing.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.370
Mr. Wu.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.250
Thank you.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.460
But

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.180
if the result

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.820
isn't what you want,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.420
you'll have to accept it.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.250
So, what did you

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.650
find with those bones?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.300
They're in the autopsy room.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.300
Come on.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.820
Mr. Qi.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.490
Mr. Han.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.490
These bones come

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.460
from multiple victims, right?

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.300
Yes.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.890
The left and right femurs

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.460
aren't from the same person.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.250
The left and right arm bones

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.460
aren't from the same person.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.890
The limbs and pelvis don't match.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.890
The thoracic

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.420
and cervical vertebrae

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.420
don't match either.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.100
The hand

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.010
and foot aren't

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.300
from the same person.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.100
And the skull

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.100
is missing.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.650
How many people?

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.100
These are at least ten people's bones.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.100
Ten people died?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.700
Was this treated

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.650
the same way as the

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.890
bones from last time?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.180
The bone surfaces are
covered in phenolic resin.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.130
And these bones

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.340
show no signs of natural erosion

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.420
or

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.850
natural ossification.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.420
It seems someone

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.060
removed the skin and flesh

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.460
from the bone surfaces.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.420
Current test results indicate

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.650
that the skin and flesh

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.650
were removed from the bone

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.370
using acid washing.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.420
What about the DNA?

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.300
Have you extracted

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.490
a comparable sample?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.940
No, we couldn't extract it.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.940
Same as last time.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.530
What about the clothing

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.490
fibers found at the scene?

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.940
Evidence Department has it.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.580
Has anyone gone to Liu Yuanyuan's

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.250
house to collect samples?

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.180
Sampling has been done.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:30.850
DNA has also

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.460
been extracted.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.890
Now we can only wait for the results

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.100
of the clothing fiber analysis.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.060
Mr. Han,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.420
the results are out.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.130
We found two

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.010
complete DNA sets.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.700
One set with more samples

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.010
is definitely Liu Yuanyuan's.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.820
The other set with fewer samples,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.820
we think,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.100
was left by people who had

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.060
contact with this clothing.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.530
Could it be one

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.370
of the victims?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.650
Mr. Qi hasn't extracted

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.530
any comparable DNA

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.420
from the bones yet.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.010
Based on the current clues,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:17.980
it can be confirmed

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.770
that there are at least ten victims.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.370
The murderer first dealt

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.730
with the flesh of the corpses,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.820
then took a portion from each skeleton

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.130
to assemble a human figure,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.370
and discarded them

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.700
in various places around the city.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.130
But the strangest thing

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.650
is that among

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.980
the ten corpses,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.940
we could not extract DNA

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.890
to confirm the identities

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.220
of the deceased.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.370
Let me go over it again.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.490
The suspect Liu Yuanyuan

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.060
is 1.7 meters tall.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.010
According to her colleagues,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.580
she weighs about 50 kilograms.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.730
We found the

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.420
clothes she wore at one

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.700
of the dumping sites.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.820
And we already know

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.130
she bought a powerful solvent

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.010
and knives

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.980
at a supermarket.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.250
These bones are all quite intact.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.100
Phenolic resin adheres to the

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.100
bones quite completely.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.610
This requires the murderer's

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.730
skills to be very high level.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.370
Liu Yuanyuan

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.580
has no relevant

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.940
professional knowledge.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.820
For an ordinary person,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.220
dismembering ten people,

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.580
dissolving the bodies,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.700
and distributing

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.610
the pieces over four

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.980
or five days

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.940
is not easy.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.460
Mr. Qi is right.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:26.890
Impossible.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.700
Impossible.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.730
Not to mention Liu Yuanyuan,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.700
even a professional couldn't dismantle

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.940
and dump bodies

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.010
without leaving a clue.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.890
There are indeed too many

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:37.820
doubts here.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.980
Liu Yuanyuan and her neighbors

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.060
live very close

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.940
to each other.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.980
If she killed and dismembered

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.130
ten people,

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.460
it's hard to imagine

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.820
that place being the first crime scene.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.180
And we have checked

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.340
all the dumping sites.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.770
There is no related

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.850
bloodstain or weapon.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.530
This shows that these two sites

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.180
were not the actual

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.370
first scene of the case.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.010
It could also indicate

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.940
that Liu Yuanyuan didn't do it.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.010
She might just be a smokescreen

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.820
the murderer used

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.460
to mislead us.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.060
Could it be a gang operation?

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.940
That is possible.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.250
Based on the time the

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.180
informants reported,

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.530
the murderer completed all the

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.770
dumping actions in a short

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.370
period of time, even overnight.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.890
This also fits the theory

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.010
of a group crime.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.180
Well,

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.130
the places they chose

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.130
to dump were

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.250
under bridges,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.940
in small wooded areas in parks,

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.220
or in abandoned factories.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.010
There weren't cameras at those places.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.340
This suggests

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.820
the murderer carefully

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.130
evaluated and selected

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.250
these dumping sites.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.250
Could the hand and foot bones

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.530
found by the couple on Beishan

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.580
be the last part

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.770
the murderer dumped?

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.010
Otherwise, why burn the clothes?

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.530
I remember the

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.700
first security guard

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.650
who reported seeing a figure.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.180
He thought he was exposed,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.770
so he burned the clothes

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.610
after dumping the bodies?

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.700
Like Wan just said,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.340
this is a tightly

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.850
planned crime.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.220
The urgent task now

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.570
is to find Liu Yuanyuan.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.570
Liu Yuanyuan lives

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.140
in an old community.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.250
We only found a fragment

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.900
of surveillance footage that remains.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.380
It shows

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.420
that four days ago

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.010
when she last appeared,

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.250
she was wearing

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.980
that red jacket and carrying

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.290
a black shoulder bag.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.700
Liu Yuanyuan disappeared

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.980
at the end of an alley

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.570
in surveillance.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.330
The alley leads

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.140
to a night market.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.380
There're no cameras in the night market.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.010
The market has many exits.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.620
These exits lead

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.530
to main roads

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.460
that do have cameras.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.010
If we want

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.980
to find her last image,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.220
this investigation

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.050
will be very difficult.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:40.860
This workload,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.810
even if we include the entire team

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.570
or even all

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.980
the officers in the district,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.530
would take about two weeks.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.420
Is it possible

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.900
that Liu Yuanyuan never

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.810
left the night market?

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.890
Given the severity of the case,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.650
we've decided

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.740
to establish a special task force

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.290
to concentrate efforts on solving it.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.330
To improve efficiency,

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.290
the bureau has decided

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.980
to have Qi Sizhe join the task force

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:08.980
to assist you.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:09.770
Yes.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.490
Hello, have you

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.490
seen her before?

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.980
No.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.860
Are you sure?

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.380
Okay, thank you.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.810
Let's go check there.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.220
Hello,

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.620
have you seen her before?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.530
No.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.700
Hello,

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.490
have you seen her before?

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.620
No.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.380
Do you know her?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.490
No.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.900
Thank you.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.810
Hello,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.250
have you seen her before?

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.940
I've driven her before.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.090
Are you sure?

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.980
Of course.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.980
She's incredibly stingy.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.050
We agreed on eight yuan.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.180
After I took her there,

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.220
she only gave me five yuan.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.730
Liu Yuanyuan

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.980
is usually very frugal

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.290
and rarely takes taxis.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.140
Where did you take her?

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.460
Who are you?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.660
We are...

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.460
Here.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.900
We're not stingy.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.090
Take us to the place she's been.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.250
Take it.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.380
Call Ms. Zhu and Wan over.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.050
Okay.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:56.860
Stop.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.810
Rewind it a bit.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.090
Found her!

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.700
Where did she go?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.250
There are many buildings.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.250
I'm not sure.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.730
Are there any other videos?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.530
Several buildings

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.810
are currently under renovation.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.380
The cameras are being replaced.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.570
The place she went

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.420
happened to be in the same direction.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.250
What a coincidence.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.460
Could this be the

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.530
primary crime scene?

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.090
The school is too big.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.290
We need time to investigate.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.290
Wan,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.050
go ask the school leaders

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.860
to cooperate.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.090
Check if anyone else saw Liu Yuanyuan

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.420
on the day she came in.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.250
Okay.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.380
Su,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.700
make a copy of all the

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.090
video footage from the day

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.940
Liu Yuanyuan

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.770
disappeared until now.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.140
Then check with Li to see

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.010
if there are any other

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.860
videos of her.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:47.770
- Okay.
- Ms. Zhu,

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.660
let's go back to see

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.810
if there are any new clues.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.420
Okay.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.330
The beef is here.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.460
Here you go.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.700
Thanks, Song.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.330
Mr. Qi,

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.290
don't you think

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.700
Song seems troubled lately?

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.490
He hasn't said much

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.860
the last two times we've come.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.090
Eat.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.900
Song.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.460
Two cut noodles.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.660
I was thinking of going back

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.770
to the station to see

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:39.900
if you'd made any new discoveries.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.810
But you're here.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.140
It's lunchtime. We have to eat.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.900
Okay.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.010
We can't

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:46.660
figure out

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.420
the bones.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.810
So we thought

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.530
we'd come over

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.620
to clear our heads.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.660
Maybe we'll figure it out.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.660
Why aren't you eating?

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.290
No appetite.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.220
Mr. Qi.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.700
Mr. Gao.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.660
Mr. Han,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.250
we only found out

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.090
that Liu Yuanyuan went

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.220
to He City Medical University.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.460
But that school is too big.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.900
Surveillance isn't effective.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.660
We might need manual investigation

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.010
to see if we can find something.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.220
Medical University?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.050
Why would she

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.860
go there?

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.490
Don't talk about work.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.330
Lunch first.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.380
Come on.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.250
You two have

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.940
to try this braised beef.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.330
Why?

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.620
This is a must-eat dish

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.050
for medical

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.010
and law students.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.530
At our first anatomy class,

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.420
we saw all the human organs

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.490
and skin tissues

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.700
soaked in formalin.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.810
It's the same way they make

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:47.460
braised beef.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.700
So after class,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.140
our professor would take
us for braised beef.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.180
Anyone who threw up

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.620
would fail the course.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:56.810
Gao Yuan.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.460
What did you just say?

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.700
I said we used to eat braised beef

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.140
after anatomy class.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.770
I know why now.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.900
I know why DNA can't be

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.570
extracted

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.380
from bones, and why

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.050
there's phenolic resin.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.180
There's another possibility.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.220
These skeletal remains,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.250
from which no DNA could be extracted,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.090
showed no signs of insect

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.460
or microbial erosion,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.050
nor any trace

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.810
of natural decomposition.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.530
The murderer used some solution

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.810
to dissolve the flesh

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.180
and skin on the bones.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.570
Therefore, we initially assumed

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.810
these were recently

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.090
murdered victims.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.180
Yes.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.660
Because someone did indeed

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.140
dissolve the flesh and skin.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.290
But they didn't just

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.900
separate the flesh and skin.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:52.980
They also chemically

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.010
treated the remains.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.380
You have any ideas?

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.860
I think

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.900
these remains

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.180
aren't the bones

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.290
of victims at all.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.980
They are specimens.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.330
Specimens?

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.220
That's why there's

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.420
phenolic resin on the bones?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.700
Formaldehyde and phenol

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.940
undergo condensation polymerization.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.570
The resulting compound

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.420
is the phenolic resin

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.220
we find on the bone surface.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.770
You mean

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.900
this yellow powder

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.330
wasn't attached

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.220
at the crime scene

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.860
but rather formed by the murderer

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.380
simultaneously using these two

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.330
substances on the bones,

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:27.860
creating phenolic resin?

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:28.530
That's right.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.220
If formaldehyde is prepared

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.700
as an aqueous solution,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.380
at a concentration of 37% to 40%,

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:35.900
it becomes formalin.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.940
And this explains

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.900
the question

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.090
I've been

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.220
struggling with.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.180
Why we couldn't

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.090
extract DNA

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.420
from the

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.460
skeletal remains.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.090
All the skeletal remains we found

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.860
were human specimens

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.140
soaked in formalin, right?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.090
Yes.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.490
The DNA structure of specimens

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:56.250
soaked in formalin

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.290
for a long time

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.090
is destroyed.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.420
This also explains

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.380
why the surface of these bones

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.620
hasn't undergone the

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.770
natural erosion process
of osteoclastic resorption.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.940
The murderer used the chemical reaction

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.050
between these two substances

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.770
removing any formalin residue,

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.980
and then disposed of these bones.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.980
His purpose was

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.490
to keep us in the dark

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.010
about where the

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.900
remains came from.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.250
The murderer's random disposal

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.730
was the first layer of defense.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.090
When we found these remains,

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.050
his complex operations served

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:38.940
as the second

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.090
layer of defense.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.490
This made us not think

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.940
that these were human specimens,

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.010
leading us to believe

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.770
that these were recent victims.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.140
If this is the case,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.090
does it mean there were no victims?

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.530
The murderer used such a complex

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.530
method to mislead us.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.940
He must have something

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.860
he wanted to cover up.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.660
Where were these human specimens

00:26:59.030 --> 00:26:59.770
supposed to be?

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:02.940
Medical University.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.330
Mr. Han!

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.810
This is the head

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.490
of security.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.860
Hello.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.620
Hello, Mr. Han.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.660
Welcome.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.330
This is the specimen building?

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:29.980
Yes.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.570
It was the laboratory building.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.010
After a new building was built,

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.770
this place was abandoned.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.250
Only one room was left

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:35.980
as the specimen room.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.220
Is there surveillance around here?

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.380
Who would come here?

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.660
Because there aren't

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.220
any valuables here,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.380
the cameras haven't been

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.620
replaced since they broke.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.810
Only the administrator

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.620
has the key to the

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.220
specimen room.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.010
Not many people come here.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.460
He's the security guard.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.250
Just one security guard?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:53.900
Yes,

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.940
he works during the day.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.290
The door is locked at night.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:57.490
Liu.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:27:59.660
They are police officers.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.420
Hello.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.380
Have you seen her before?

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:07.940
No.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:08.660
Are you sure?

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.180
Yes.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.700
Thank you.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:13.570
Ms. Zhu,

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.330
I'll take Mr. Qi inside to take a look.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.660
You and Wan, go check

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.770
if there are any other exits.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.380
This way.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.660
How could there be any

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.700
missing specimens here?

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:34.460
Although there's one security guard,

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.940
we have always maintained

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.940
strict management.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.380
Yes.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.770
This area is my responsibility.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.090
If anything's missing, I'll be expelled.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.620
Come on.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.570
Okay.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.380
Be careful.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.660
I'll go over there.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.940
Xiaoxi,

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.770
go check if there

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.660
are any cameras.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.010
Okay. Be careful.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.730
Are there only five body donors here?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.530
Yes.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.860
Mr. Han.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.050
All the specimens are here,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.010
and they all match the records.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.090
The most recent return dates

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.940
are all over a year ago.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.490
Is this the only

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.620
specimen room?

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.180
Yes,

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.090
only this one.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.420
Is there anywhere else in He City

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.420
besides here to store

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.620
human specimens?

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.530
No.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.050
Su.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.380
You just said the

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.700
most recent return

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.460
record for these specimens

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.980
is over a year ago?

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.090
But these specimen jars

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.730
were recently moved.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:52.940
Su,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.220
find out what's going on.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.090
Then call the technical department.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:56.700
Okay.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.250
Come on, come with me.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:00.700
Lead the way.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.090
Officer,

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.010
what exactly happened?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.570
I only have this one key.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.250
I always carry it with me.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.980
I even take it with me

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.330
to the bathroom.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.220
I really don't know

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:44.490
how the specimens

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:45.570
could have been moved.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.250
You sit here every day?

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.290
There's only

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.220
one entrance.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.810
You should know

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:52.660
who comes in.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.900
Did they register?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.460
Actually,

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.810
I've always been here.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:04.330
Sitting here

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.620
or lying down?

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.620
Hey,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.770
what can you see like this?

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.460
The logistics department

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.770
has taken all the keys.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.810
Only the specimen room

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.460
key is with me.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.290
If someone comes to borrow
a specimen or a cadaver,

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.380
they'll bring an approval slip.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.810
Then I take them there.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.570
No one comes at other times.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.660
This is the approval slip?

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.290
Quite a few people came here.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.050
They're all teachers and students.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.140
Seven or eight a day.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.620
Do they notify

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.570
you beforehand?

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:42.530
No.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.660
Just bring the approval slip.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.730
Okay, I got it.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.700
I'll take this.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.770
Anything else?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.050
No.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.570
Mr. Qi,

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.980
judging from their size,

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.090
these body parts all

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.730
come from the same corpse.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.380
But the only missing

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.220
piece is her head.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.290
It's now confirmed

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.490
that the murderer

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.660
first killed and dismembered the victim,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.090
replacing the body parts with those

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.900
in the specimen room.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.660
Then, he disposed of the
specimen room parts,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.900
leaving the remains,

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.810
which he scattered in various locations.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.530
I noticed

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.660
that all the cuts on the body parts

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.900
are very clean.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.730
They were made at the bone joints.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.180
It seems the murderer

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.980
had a considerable understanding

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.010
of human anatomy

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.980
and anatomical knowledge.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.330
However, we didn't find any

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.180
fatal wounds on the body.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:56.860
There's redness at the ankle.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.180
But the body

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.290
was soaked in formalin.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.460
We can't determine

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.090
the cause of this

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.220
at the moment.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:07.660
Well,

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.860
let's perform tissue separation on the

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.210
legs and try to extract DNA.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.170
Okay.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.210
Okay, got it.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:41.900
Mr. Han,

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.690
we checked

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:43.530
Liu Yuanyuan's call records

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:44.460
and social connections.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.340
She had no contact

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.170
with that guard.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.490
Mr. Han.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.340
What did you find?

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.340
There's a section of

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.780
wire mesh at the southeast corner

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.900
behind the specimen building.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.740
We found a torn hole.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.650
But judging from the rust,

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.090
it wasn't done recently.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.130
After our investigation,

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.610
we found that if Liu Yuanyuan

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.490
really did commit murder

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.570
and dismemberment at the school,

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:06.380
she could only have done
it in the specimen room.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.530
But currently,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.780
we have no evidence

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.420
to prove she went to the specimen room.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.690
Before they moved,

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:13.650
all the keys were given

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:14.570
to the logistics department.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.900
We just checked.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.050
The only place she could

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.340
go was the specimen room.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.690
That doesn't make sense.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:21.820
It's also possible

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.050
that she committed

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.210
the murder outside,

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.090
brought the body parts in,

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.570
and then had the guard switch them.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.570
But Liu Yuanyuan didn't seem

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.300
to be avoiding the cameras.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.940
If her bag really

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.090
contained body parts,

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.650
she should have avoided them.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.090
Have you got the results?

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.010
The DNA of missing persons

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.860
and bone fragments

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.900
didn't match.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.490
The leg tissue

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.210
results are out?

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.980
The victim had arthritis.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.490
Arthritis?

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.010
Notify the technical department

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.170
to go to her house to collect

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.820
her fingerprints

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.690
and DNA samples.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.690
Bring back everything

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.530
she used before.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.650
Was there a bottle

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.940
of painkillers

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.170
for arthritis among the

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.980
medicine bottles

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.740
Ms. Zhu collected?

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:27.860
Yes.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.490
There is one person's DNA

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.260
that we have not compared.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.050
We have the surveillance footage.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:45.820
Okay. Get in.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.650
The body parts in the

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.570
specimen room have confirmed.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.860
It's Liu Yuanyuan's.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.980
The murderer hid the body in a specimen.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.860
The specimen room is likely
the primary crime scene.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:31.460
Who are you?

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.820
What are you doing in my office?

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.260
You wanted to use Liu Yuanyuan
for live experiments.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.860
So you hid her head?

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:37.650
Got it.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.460
Since you found out,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.260
I confess.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.460
He confessed?

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.170
Not many people know about this.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.570
They're from Medical University.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.490
Someone was helping him.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.900
I found the information on Ding Youmei

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.820
you mentioned.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.650
She's now also an assistant at He City

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.570
Medical University.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:51.380
I've seen Li Ming

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.210
wear this watch.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.940
Wake up.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.940
Not everyone's connected to Raw Diamond.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.050
Do your job.
