00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.690
These few put up a fight.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.410
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.200
Where's Guo Yaoyang?

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.390
Hey, you.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.070
Where is Guo Yaoyang?

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.730
He climbed over the wall and ran.

Captain Zhong.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.960
In Guo Yaoyang's office,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.690
we found a large amount of cash.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.790
Everyone stay put and behave.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.010
Captain Zhong.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.160
Didn't expect things to get this big.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.560

That's great.

Good.

I see.

What's with all the fuss?

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.990
Illicit funds were seized at the scene.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.850
How much?

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.290
I don't know.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.670
They said they'd only counted halfway.

They're requisitioning
money-counting machines

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.870
from various units.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.600
The machines malfunctioned
when the amount exceeded ten million.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.790
Let me tell you.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.470
In terms of this case,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.600
you two

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.550

Thank you.

I will personally present you
with a commendation banner.

Don't talk nonsense.

This has nothing to do with us.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.240
What does this have to do with us?

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.960

Drinking so much every day,
isn't he messing up his work?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.550
How can his boss trust him?

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.220
Exactly.

Go ahead.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.800
My name is Liu Tianye.

We're from Longwan.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.310
I heard that in

if anyone wants to do beef business,

they need

your approval, Ba.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.240

Are you dreaming?

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.130
Not competing,

you can just sit back

Try it then.

Don't push your luck.

You're being too polite.

What do you have in mind?

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.270
The number of ships depends on
how you plan to use them.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:18.950
It's like this.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.500
Someone introduced me
to a business opportunity before,

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.110
but I don't have my own ships,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.880

Qin Feng, come to my office.

Okay.

Well done, kid.

You quietly made your way into my team.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.340
I got in on my own merit.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.830
That way, I wouldn't embarrass you.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.330
Good.

Are you free tonight?

Yes,

what's up?

It's the Champions League tonight.

I'd like you to watch the game with me,

and discuss some business matters.

I'll meet you at Grand Paradise then.

No need to go to Grand Paradise.

That place is too noisy.

Mr. Biao.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.220
That's Mr. Liu from Longwan.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.260
Hello, Mr. Liu.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.580
These three are colleagues
from Mr. Liu's company.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.720
This is my brother Yaoyang.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.480
He used to

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.840
manage a venue for me,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.730
but it got raided by the police.

Now he has no choice but to leave town.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.340
and second,

is enough for you to live abroad

You're efficient

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.640
and don't talk too much.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.200
Such a shame.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.470

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.820
if you put him up to this.

I know you two are related,

with the Ma Jin situation for so long.

No, he won't.

We did it.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.880
So now He Biao

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.670
doesn't want us to leave the ship,

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.840
and we can't.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.640
You guys...

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.410
Why?

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.610
Why did you do it?

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.610
Because Ma Jin got Jiangyong killed,

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.410
so we avenged him.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.680
If you want to back out now,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.930
that's fine.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.030
You can stay out

But the logistics company

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.840
is your responsibility.

Tianye.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.900
This isn't the same

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.490
as smuggling.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.180
This is about someone's life.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.660
We can't do this anymore.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.200
We all have families.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.429
I'll handle things with He Biao.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.840
Consider my suggestion.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.110
If you want out,

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.590
I support you.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.210
Let's...

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.050
Let's deal with the body first.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.320
Did you see how Schweinsteiger
played this match?

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.760
Could he even pass the ball
accurately to anyone?

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.040
If it were not Schweinsteiger coming on…

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.030
Yeah.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.440
What kind of game
was Schweinsteiger playing?

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.240
Even that pass got intercepted?

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.960
Never reached his feet.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.070
Yes, there was definitely an issue.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.550
Right, if that pass had been on target,

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.610
wouldn't the score be different now?

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.550
Clean it up.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.480

you're back.

They are my college classmates.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.360
Everyone's free during the holiday,

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.360
so we got together to watch a game.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.040
Yes.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.760
It's getting late. We should go, right?

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.320
Let's go.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:06.960
Let's go.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.440
Goodbye, sir.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.240
Goodbye, sir.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.190
Dad,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.610
I'm going to bed too.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.960
Wait.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.890
What is it?

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.920
Go get me two beers.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:13.880
You're all grown up now.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.840
No need to hide

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:18.840
the drinking

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.880
and smoking from me anymore.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.360
Just don't fall behind in your studies.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360
Don't worry, Dad.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.880
Come on,

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.920
let's have a drink together.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.050
You'll graduate in a few years.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.000
Let me know your plans

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.440
in advance.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.190
Whether you want to pursue
graduate school or study abroad,

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.790
I'll support you either way.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:56.030
Dad.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.410
Did something happen?

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.110
Nothing.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.370
Are you hungry?

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.320
I'll make you some noodles,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.760
and prepare some cold dishes

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.960
to go with the drinks.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.150
Okay.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.150
Tianye, do you still have

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.850
that blood smell on you?

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.280
I feel like that smell

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.610
just won't wash off.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.590
Let's not talk about this.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.670
Get some good sleep when you get back.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.330
Don't mention this to anyone.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.000
He Biao is using us.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.490
What are we going to do?

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.590
We can't really go around killing people.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:02.850
He's not just using us.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.670
Right now,

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.860
he's putting us between him and Feng.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.760
If anything happens,
he'll throw us under the bus.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.930
I don't want to end up like Guo Yaoyang.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.760
Tianye.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.720
-What are you doing?
-Washing the car.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.690
Where have you been? You're so dirty.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:22.940
Taoyi,

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.880
what's that on your clothes?

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.760
Nothing.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.230
It's blood?

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.190
Well,

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.390
we were watching a game at the bar,

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.630
had some drinks,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.070
got into an argument with someone,

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:34.930
and had a fight.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.710
No one got hurt, right?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:38.480
No, no.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.450
Fighting over a game?

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.800
Jiangyan, don't tell anyone about this.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.930
It's embarrassing.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.360
At least you know it's embarrassing.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.190
Let's wash the car first.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.800
We have things to do tomorrow.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.630
Let's get out of here when we're done.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.590
Are you sure you're okay?

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.450
Yeah. I'm okay.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.920
Then I'll go upstairs
to put something away.
