WEBVTT

01:16.063 --> 01:16.896
Yeah...

01:17.896 --> 01:19.229
Come on, fall!

01:38.146 --> 01:40.062
They must really like you.

01:40.063 --> 01:41.687
Sending you expensive eel.

01:41.688 --> 01:43.105
It's not that they like me.

01:43.688 --> 01:45.604
They're going to work me even harder.

01:45.938 --> 01:47.271
Those Americans too

01:47.604 --> 01:50.521
must know that eels
make men perform better.

01:51.813 --> 01:54.646
They even sent it on your birthday.

01:57.688 --> 01:58.813
The kids will hear!

01:59.813 --> 02:03.312
I need eel! Eel!

02:03.521 --> 02:05.021
Come and eat!

02:05.646 --> 02:09.438
Dad sweated in the heat grilling these.

02:09.730 --> 02:10.729
I'll go.

02:17.813 --> 02:18.729
A snake?

02:19.771 --> 02:21.228
Snakes don't taste this good!

02:21.229 --> 02:24.146
Dad's company sent it,
for doing a good job.

02:24.438 --> 02:25.813
It's not even a holiday.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.604
Couldn't they give us beef?

02:29.855 --> 02:30.855
Ri-one.

02:31.438 --> 02:32.396
Dinner.

02:35.271 --> 02:37.855
Come on. Let's eat.

02:39.479 --> 02:41.146
Let the cello take a nap.

02:45.354 --> 02:46.521
What's this?

02:56.062 --> 02:58.855
Honey!

03:01.730 --> 03:03.938
Must've been expensive!

03:05.021 --> 03:08.104
Well, I can afford decent dance shoes.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.271
- Aren't Mom's shoes pretty?
- Eat up.

03:14.312 --> 03:16.187
I'll be able to dance so well in these.

03:19.563 --> 03:22.271
They say not to gift shoes to your lover.

03:22.688 --> 03:23.271
Why?

03:23.438 --> 03:24.146
Why?

03:24.438 --> 03:26.563
‘Cause they might run away in them.

03:27.646 --> 03:30.521
Seems your dad is confident.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.104
Come on.

03:34.187 --> 03:36.104
We need to practice when we can.

03:37.896 --> 03:39.479
Ready, start!

03:39.896 --> 03:41.645
One two three,

03:41.646 --> 03:45.729
two two three, three two three...

04:10.896 --> 04:13.478
Thanks for your hard work
and years of dedication to Solar Paper.

04:13.479 --> 04:15.563
Damned paper...

04:16.604 --> 04:18.477
Honey, come here.

04:18.478 --> 04:19.438
Why?

04:21.354 --> 04:21.979
Come on.

04:23.729 --> 04:25.146
Come on, Ri-one.

04:27.771 --> 04:33.896
Ri-two Si-two

04:37.771 --> 04:39.187
Just three minutes more.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.396
One minute...

04:49.938 --> 04:51.563
Know what I'm feeling now?

04:55.312 --> 04:56.813
I've got it all.

05:33.062 --> 05:37.688
You people bought Solar Paper,
where I devoted 25 years of my life.

05:38.438 --> 05:40.228
But as soon as you take over, you say

05:40.229 --> 05:42.688
you'll cut 20% of the production line?

05:43.354 --> 05:45.563
And you ask for a list
of names to fire?

05:46.479 --> 05:49.354
Names of veterans
who taught me their craft?

05:50.312 --> 05:52.895
Names of young men
who came of age in this factory?

05:54.146 --> 05:56.855
Innocent workers who lovingly
cared for these machines,

05:57.104 --> 06:00.479
you want me to point a gun at their heads?

06:01.604 --> 06:02.895
I can't do it.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.728
Guns are meant to be aimed
at one's enemies!

06:06.729 --> 06:07.603
Stop! Think! Act!

06:07.604 --> 06:10.563
I cannot give you that list.

06:13.062 --> 06:15.104
You Americans say

06:15.354 --> 06:16.979
to be fired is to be ‘axed'?

06:17.813 --> 06:19.646
Know what we say in Korea?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.187
Off with your head!

06:21.563 --> 06:23.396
So being fired

06:24.646 --> 06:28.271
is having your head chopped
clear off with an ax!

06:33.895 --> 06:34.978
Job for life, old shoes

06:34.979 --> 06:37.937
“If you don't start a union,
we guarantee a job for life.”

06:38.312 --> 06:42.854
That beautiful tradition...
tossed out like old shoes!

06:43.146 --> 06:45.103
To you Americans...!

06:45.104 --> 06:46.271
Damn, my throat...

06:46.854 --> 06:48.646
I said to do this in the warehouse.

06:49.271 --> 06:51.146
All because you wanted to smoke.

06:52.062 --> 06:52.978
Quit, dammit!

06:52.979 --> 06:55.145
You put so much work into this.

06:55.146 --> 06:57.061
He could've said, forget it.

06:57.062 --> 07:00.646
- But he acts like it's his job at stake.
- It is!

07:00.854 --> 07:03.270
If you guys are fired,
who will I work with?

07:03.271 --> 07:04.979
Real sense of humanity.

07:05.521 --> 07:06.521
Damn.

07:09.187 --> 07:10.187
Stop!

07:18.187 --> 07:19.146
Hello, sir.

07:29.854 --> 07:31.395
Off with your head!

07:31.396 --> 07:33.687
- So to be fired...
- Give back the helmet!

07:33.688 --> 07:35.646
...is to chop your head clear off!

07:36.020 --> 07:36.812
Wait!

07:38.312 --> 07:40.229
What'll he do with that helmet?

07:47.563 --> 07:48.229
They didn't...

07:49.271 --> 07:50.521
give you the eel, did they?

07:55.354 --> 07:56.604
No way, right?

08:04.438 --> 08:05.312
Honey.

08:06.937 --> 08:07.688
What?

08:08.354 --> 08:09.979
You said you'd say something.

08:12.312 --> 08:13.271
I forgot.

08:13.521 --> 08:15.103
Aren't you going to work?

08:15.104 --> 08:16.229
Right, right.

08:16.604 --> 08:17.438
That's right.

08:19.354 --> 08:20.937
Si-two Ri-two, house!

08:21.854 --> 08:23.187
Study hard.

08:25.646 --> 08:27.769
- Ri-one, let's go.
- Ri-one!

08:27.770 --> 08:30.020
Have a good day.

08:35.604 --> 08:36.146
Good luck!

08:38.979 --> 08:41.312
I slaved for 25 years!

08:49.604 --> 08:50.688
Deep breaths.

09:07.354 --> 09:08.979
- I am...
- I am...

09:09.479 --> 09:10.604
A good person.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.145
A good person.

09:12.146 --> 09:13.062
Man-su!

09:13.770 --> 09:14.520
...person.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.271
- Losing my job...
- Losing my job...

09:16.770 --> 09:19.104
- Losing my job!
- Losing my job...

09:19.812 --> 09:23.062
is not my choice!

09:26.354 --> 09:29.228
- My loving family...
- My loving family...

09:29.229 --> 09:31.020
My loving family...

09:31.895 --> 09:35.312
will support me fully
as I seek new opportunities.

09:35.770 --> 09:39.770
...as I seek new opportunities.

09:40.438 --> 09:44.479
My loving family will support me fully

09:44.770 --> 09:46.728
as I seek new opportunities.

09:52.979 --> 09:54.271
Honey.

09:55.229 --> 09:56.727
Can you put in earphones?

09:56.728 --> 09:57.979
Just a sec.

09:59.479 --> 10:01.062
Hired in 3 months

10:05.104 --> 10:08.604
So you must've had
sleepless nights?

10:12.479 --> 10:13.645
Are you crying?

10:16.312 --> 10:21.020
Where's that brave bachelor
who proposed to a single mom?

10:21.812 --> 10:25.854
I made a new start, you can too.

10:27.187 --> 10:28.769
Sure you can!

10:28.770 --> 10:32.145
Take all your hopes and dreams,

10:32.146 --> 10:35.312
and recite your own incantation.

10:36.354 --> 10:37.146
Ready?

10:37.354 --> 10:38.645
Go!

10:41.479 --> 10:42.395
A new start...

10:42.396 --> 10:44.146
A new start... A new start...

10:44.645 --> 10:45.603
A new start.

10:45.937 --> 10:46.854
A new start.

10:47.729 --> 10:49.062
I'm head of a family.

10:50.563 --> 10:51.770
I'll be born again.

10:53.229 --> 10:56.687
To put food in my family's mouths...

10:57.521 --> 10:59.020
there's nothing I won't do.

11:01.438 --> 11:02.770
In three months,

11:04.812 --> 11:06.312
I'll get hired again!

11:10.312 --> 11:11.812
I feel great!

11:14.770 --> 11:17.478
3 Months Later

11:17.479 --> 11:20.520
13 Months Later

11:20.521 --> 11:22.686
Hi Namgu, I know.

11:22.687 --> 11:23.769
Today at 5 o'clock.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.937
My boss is really curious about you.

11:26.479 --> 11:30.187
Sorry to ask so suddenly,
but can you come at noon?

11:30.438 --> 11:31.979
Listen, I'm...

11:33.020 --> 11:35.020
at the retail store, with my wife.

11:36.396 --> 11:40.602
The boss suddenly booked
a 5pm flight back to China.

11:40.603 --> 11:41.270
Too much to ask?

11:41.271 --> 11:42.937
No no, hold on.

11:43.229 --> 11:43.895
Wait.

11:44.229 --> 11:46.978
I'll plead with my wife.

11:46.979 --> 11:49.854
That's right. Come over now.

11:50.396 --> 11:54.520
But there's a question he always asks.
“What's your weak point?”

11:54.895 --> 11:55.769
Weak point?

11:55.770 --> 12:00.437
It's a crucial-utely sensitive issue, okay?

12:00.438 --> 12:01.812
Okay, thanks!

12:23.895 --> 12:24.936
Weak point?

12:24.937 --> 12:28.019
Sorry, I know it's absolutely
impossible to answer.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.769
What's my weak point?

12:29.770 --> 12:33.978
What do you think?
You love plants too much.

12:33.979 --> 12:35.438
You're a vegetable.

12:36.312 --> 12:38.562
Last night you called me an animal.

12:41.062 --> 12:43.396
Namgu gave me this awesome tip.

12:44.770 --> 12:46.561
Mortgage Default Warning

12:46.562 --> 12:48.979
If only I can explain
my weak point well.

12:49.312 --> 12:51.895
It's a crucial-utely sensitive issue.

12:53.271 --> 12:57.769
If you're hired, you'll work
under your former subordinate Namgu.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.603
Tell us how you feel about that.

13:00.062 --> 13:01.936
I was a manager, true,

13:01.937 --> 13:06.020
but I've always considered
myself to be blue collar.

13:08.603 --> 13:10.311
So, in that respect...

13:10.312 --> 13:13.770
I don't think you understood the question.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.561
Namgu—

13:16.562 --> 13:19.437
No, of course I understand, my point is...

13:20.229 --> 13:24.104
Namgu came to Papyrus first,
so you'll learn from him, right?

13:24.312 --> 13:25.312
Of course!

13:26.271 --> 13:27.854
I am always learning.

13:28.312 --> 13:32.020
I got hired as soon as
I graduated from high school.

13:32.687 --> 13:37.228
But even while working,
I earned a chemistry degree.

13:37.229 --> 13:40.271
Of course, that was at
a distance university.

13:43.645 --> 13:48.271
Of course after that too,
I kept... learning.

13:48.562 --> 13:51.520
And of course, safety management.

13:52.478 --> 13:59.811
When I received the 2019
‘Pulp Man of the Year', it was that aspect

13:59.812 --> 14:02.146
that they singled out in my record.

14:02.812 --> 14:05.561
And that same year,

14:05.562 --> 14:08.271
I finally bought my own home.

14:09.062 --> 14:12.062
The very house I was born in.

14:12.395 --> 14:13.645
Of course...

14:14.354 --> 14:16.895
I'm saying “of course” too much, aren't I?

14:19.271 --> 14:22.770
It's not so much because I'm nervous,

14:23.395 --> 14:27.478
but... self-confidence? Assurance?
That's what it is.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.645
Of course!

14:34.062 --> 14:37.979
If you don't mind, could you
tell me about your weak point?

14:42.146 --> 14:43.187
No.

14:49.603 --> 14:54.353
...is the one thing I can't say,
that's my biggest weak point!

14:59.770 --> 15:01.645
Have you looked into Moon Paper?

15:01.895 --> 15:02.895
Moon?

15:03.562 --> 15:08.645
They say Moon Paper has cracked
the Japanese market, look into it.

15:09.020 --> 15:12.146
Pacific Paper is restructuring
this winter, too.

15:12.395 --> 15:13.020
Really?

15:14.020 --> 15:15.104
Go to a dentist, will you?

15:16.437 --> 15:17.603
Just go, okay?

15:18.812 --> 15:21.145
If you get hired,
you'll be too busy to go.

15:21.146 --> 15:22.561
No, I'm fine.

15:22.562 --> 15:25.311
There's that pigheadedness of yours!

15:26.062 --> 15:29.687
Anyway, get hired
before winter, okay?

15:30.062 --> 15:31.895
The company will call you soon.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.020
Thanks.

15:35.478 --> 15:37.895
Don't forget, Moon Paper!

15:39.562 --> 15:41.979
I'm a man. I'm a good person.

15:43.478 --> 15:46.602
Founded by legendary paper man
Moon Changho,

15:46.603 --> 15:47.686
Choi Sun-chul, Line Manager at Moon Paper

15:47.687 --> 15:49.186
- Moon Paper is...
- Mr. Choi!

15:49.187 --> 15:50.019
Yes?

15:50.020 --> 15:53.894
We agreed to talk about how paper is made.

15:53.895 --> 15:54.644
That's what I'm—

15:54.645 --> 15:56.645
Leave the promotion
to the company channel.

15:57.603 --> 15:58.894
6 hours 17 minutes later...

15:58.895 --> 16:03.062
Many people think paper companies
mindlessly raze entire forests, right?

16:03.520 --> 16:04.645
That's not true.

16:46.187 --> 16:46.687
What?

16:50.603 --> 16:52.104
First, the good news.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.687
I got a part time job.

16:54.854 --> 16:56.978
Mom's going out to work now!

16:56.979 --> 16:59.437
You always blamed us
for killing your career.

16:59.812 --> 17:00.728
Congrats, Mom!

17:00.895 --> 17:01.937
Congrats, Mom!

17:02.104 --> 17:03.395
Thanks.

17:03.729 --> 17:05.728
Where? A dental clinic?

17:06.146 --> 17:09.519
- Dr. Oh Chin-ho.
- Dr. Ouch In-ho?

17:09.520 --> 17:10.979
No jokes allowed.

17:11.394 --> 17:15.227
I'd like us all to face the fact
we're in a crisis.

17:15.729 --> 17:19.060
Refrain from the listed activities
until Dad finds work.

17:19.061 --> 17:22.812
Except for Ri-one's lessons,
anything nonessential must go.

17:23.437 --> 17:24.019
For example...

17:24.020 --> 17:25.519
For example, meat in the soup?

17:25.520 --> 17:28.020
There is some, look harder.

17:30.645 --> 17:31.770
For example,

17:32.062 --> 17:33.186
my car.

17:34.311 --> 17:36.729
We'll trade your car
for something smaller.

17:39.104 --> 17:41.353
And our house.

17:47.020 --> 17:51.437
If we sell the house, we can pay off
our loans and rent an apartment.

17:53.812 --> 17:56.394
You said you'd find work in 3 months.

17:56.395 --> 18:00.894
So we kept living as usual,
dipping into your severance pay.

18:00.895 --> 18:03.353
Now that's run dry.

18:09.478 --> 18:11.478
House Foreclosure in 3 Months

18:12.311 --> 18:13.437
Honey.

18:15.020 --> 18:16.395
This house...

18:20.437 --> 18:22.979
I have so many childhood memories
in this home.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.937
After turning 9, I moved
every 10 months on average.

18:29.104 --> 18:31.104
I worked so hard to buy back this home.

18:32.353 --> 18:33.645
I mean, we did.

18:35.062 --> 18:36.269
With my own hands,

18:36.270 --> 18:38.894
I tore down the old barn,
built the greenhouse...

18:38.895 --> 18:40.228
and the swing.

18:40.979 --> 18:42.894
Every corner of this home...

18:42.895 --> 18:43.895
Honey.

18:45.603 --> 18:48.311
If we go bankrupt, they'll take it anyway.

18:49.728 --> 18:50.769
The piano,

18:50.770 --> 18:51.936
living room table,

18:51.937 --> 18:52.936
two chairs,

18:52.937 --> 18:53.519
TV,

18:53.520 --> 18:54.436
curtain,

18:54.437 --> 18:55.144
carpet...

18:55.145 --> 18:56.769
have all been put up for sale.

18:56.770 --> 18:57.727
My racket, too.

18:57.728 --> 18:59.185
No more tennis.

18:59.186 --> 19:00.687
Let's quit dance lessons, too.

19:00.937 --> 19:02.520
Your bonsai magazine.

19:02.937 --> 19:04.895
And I'm canceling Netflix.

19:09.311 --> 19:10.186
Hey!

19:11.103 --> 19:13.687
Before it's cancelled,
I should watch one more show.

19:17.603 --> 19:21.437
So comrades, now for the bad news.

19:21.854 --> 19:23.020
Something even worse?

19:23.186 --> 19:24.520
Something even worse?

19:28.937 --> 19:32.979
In these circumstances,
we can't afford to feed so many mouths.

19:35.061 --> 19:36.937
What do you mean, so many?

19:37.478 --> 19:39.353
- Don't go, Ri-two.
- Ri-one.

19:40.186 --> 19:41.269
Si-one.

19:41.270 --> 19:43.561
We'll see them soon, okay Ri-one?

19:43.562 --> 19:45.019
Come on.

19:45.020 --> 19:48.561
You can come visit them
at our house. Okay?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.812
Si-two Ri-two will be back.
As soon as Dad gets hired.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.060
That dog hair is brutal.

20:06.061 --> 20:07.520
I'm sorry, Dad.

20:09.729 --> 20:10.729
Have a safe drive.

20:12.979 --> 20:13.769
Let's go in.

20:13.770 --> 20:14.770
Come on.

20:16.395 --> 20:18.812
I'll bring them back soon, I will.

20:25.061 --> 20:26.394
Hello, ma'am!

20:26.395 --> 20:27.979
You're here early!

20:29.812 --> 20:32.311
The potential buyer is that dickhead?

20:34.812 --> 20:37.728
Not bad for a 50-year-old house.

20:37.729 --> 20:39.145
Look at the curtains.

20:39.770 --> 20:43.686
They fixed up this ruined house so well.

20:43.687 --> 20:45.352
It's been born again.

20:45.353 --> 20:48.270
- You know my townhouse near here?
- Yes.

20:48.437 --> 20:51.729
That land was originally
part of his dad's pig farm.

20:52.186 --> 20:54.603
Wow, if he still owned that land...

20:54.812 --> 20:58.437
If we tear down that greenhouse,
it'd make a great practice green.

21:01.186 --> 21:02.437
Disgusting pig.

21:03.103 --> 21:05.854
You're quite the handyman,
You Man-su.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.687
That's enough for today.

21:14.186 --> 21:15.686
The moms are besties.

21:15.687 --> 21:17.395
The kids are besties.

21:20.729 --> 21:22.478
Pulp Man of the Year!

21:23.937 --> 21:26.019
Your dad's gun is still looking good...

21:27.228 --> 21:29.061
Vietnam War Service Certificate

21:32.728 --> 21:34.520
Oh, look here!

21:34.812 --> 21:40.935
Imagine waking up and seeing
that sturdy red pine!

21:40.936 --> 21:42.019
It's a white pine.

21:43.019 --> 21:44.019
White pine...

21:44.186 --> 21:46.853
Look around.
I'll stop by the dry cleaners.

21:46.854 --> 21:48.769
Pick up my clothes for an interview.

21:48.770 --> 21:51.103
You're a Man! Su! Fight!

21:53.395 --> 21:54.978
Shall we see the kids' rooms?

21:56.770 --> 21:59.227
With just one kid,
we'll use that as a closet.

21:59.228 --> 22:01.186
I thought that too!

22:02.978 --> 22:04.228
Nice mattress.

22:06.270 --> 22:08.186
That's for sale too, buy it.

22:12.645 --> 22:14.145
Where will you move to?

22:15.186 --> 22:17.061
Need to sell the house first.

22:18.311 --> 22:19.728
Hope you don't go far.

22:21.978 --> 22:24.978
If we leave, Si-two Ri-two
won't be able to find us.

22:25.186 --> 22:26.228
Says who?

22:36.311 --> 22:37.562
We're not leaving.

22:38.728 --> 22:39.812
I promise.

22:40.645 --> 22:44.018
Si-one Ri-one Si-one Ri-one...

22:44.019 --> 22:45.978
Si-two Ri-two Si-two...

22:46.353 --> 22:47.520
Let me through!

22:47.854 --> 22:50.186
- I'm late for a meeting.
- Listen, please.

22:51.311 --> 22:53.729
My wife is doing part time work,

22:54.019 --> 22:56.644
we put our home up for sale,

22:56.645 --> 22:58.228
- cancelled Netflix...
- What?

22:59.645 --> 23:00.602
Sir?

23:00.603 --> 23:01.395
Choi Sun-chul!

23:01.770 --> 23:03.602
What's going on? Who's this?

23:03.603 --> 23:05.602
He was fired from Solar.

23:05.603 --> 23:06.853
Just a sec.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.311
Come out.

23:12.186 --> 23:13.395
I'm sorry.

23:13.729 --> 23:14.686
Going to the meeting?

23:14.687 --> 23:16.269
I wanted to talk to you.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.061
Sure, then.

23:24.145 --> 23:26.103
Let me look...

23:26.395 --> 23:28.311
God, you're strong.

23:32.687 --> 23:34.770
If you have any shame,

23:35.437 --> 23:38.353
don't do this in a place
where people shit and piss.

23:41.978 --> 23:43.103
Sir!

23:43.770 --> 23:47.018
I told you to come visit me!
We'll have a nice barbecue.

23:47.019 --> 23:49.019
All right, then.

24:00.562 --> 24:01.353
Oh my.

24:04.437 --> 24:05.645
Listen.

24:06.728 --> 24:11.520
On the hill opposite, there's a nice
whisky bar called Moon Shine.

24:12.103 --> 24:13.729
Have a drink on your way.

24:14.228 --> 24:17.810
I just moved here to Hoi Island.

24:17.811 --> 24:19.311
It's really gorgeous.

24:19.894 --> 24:23.894
Revealed for the first time ever!
Give a shout!

24:24.603 --> 24:28.769
Barbecue over my own wood fire
is out of this world!

24:29.729 --> 24:31.729
Die!

24:45.603 --> 24:48.269
For each drop of sweat, a drop of whisky!

24:48.270 --> 24:51.768
It's what I live for.

24:51.769 --> 24:54.853
Ms. Wife

24:54.978 --> 24:55.935
Hi honey.

24:55.936 --> 24:58.936
Listen, the cello teacher called...

24:59.645 --> 25:01.478
- Where are you?
- Huh?

25:03.478 --> 25:05.103
- Are you in a bar?
- No no.

25:05.894 --> 25:07.687
Well, it's true.

25:08.645 --> 25:09.727
It's true, but I'm not.

25:09.728 --> 25:10.728
Look.

25:12.603 --> 25:13.602
I'm by myself.

25:13.603 --> 25:14.645
Have you gone mad?

25:15.395 --> 25:17.478
- I'm drinking this, really.
- Whisky?

25:17.978 --> 25:19.270
This here.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.478
You went to a bar
to drink apple juice?

25:22.811 --> 25:25.603
Honey, you trust me?

25:28.311 --> 25:30.144
Of course.

25:30.145 --> 25:31.395
Why'd the cello teacher call?

25:31.687 --> 25:37.603
I can't teach Ri-one anymore.

25:39.019 --> 25:39.810
What?

25:39.811 --> 25:42.437
Ri-one's talent is too...

25:42.936 --> 25:44.103
outstanding?

25:49.853 --> 25:51.270
But ma'am,

25:52.686 --> 25:56.145
how can I believe you?

25:57.019 --> 26:00.936
She doesn't play for us.

26:01.645 --> 26:05.311
We've never heard anything
but a few notes.

26:05.728 --> 26:06.353
Right.

26:06.562 --> 26:12.603
Why do you think I'd give up
my lesson fee to another teacher?

26:12.936 --> 26:14.102
Another teacher?

26:14.103 --> 26:17.353
Ri-one needs to learn
from a music professor now.

26:18.978 --> 26:23.061
But you should know,
the fee is on a different level than mine.

26:26.936 --> 26:32.520
You said you wanted Ri-one
to be able to live independently.

26:36.686 --> 26:39.019
If so, this level of investment—

26:39.644 --> 26:41.853
I'll say two things.

26:42.686 --> 26:47.227
Many people think paper companies
mindlessly raze entire forests, right?

26:47.228 --> 26:48.685
That's not true.

26:48.686 --> 26:52.060
Trees for paper are grown separately, cut,

26:52.061 --> 26:55.728
planted again, grown and cut again.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.227
And that's not all. There's reuse.

26:59.228 --> 27:01.562
We collect waste paper, recycle it,

27:02.728 --> 27:06.228
- then collect it again and—
- What are you watching?

27:09.145 --> 27:11.894
The only company doing well
these days is Moon Paper.

27:12.145 --> 27:15.644
They cracked the Japanese market.
He's line manager of specialty paper.

27:16.686 --> 27:19.562
A perfect job for you.
You're good at Japanese, too.

27:21.270 --> 27:25.061
Korea's the most advanced country
in paper reuse.

27:27.186 --> 27:28.353
Unlimited reuse!

27:28.727 --> 27:30.228
Freaking unlimited reuse!

27:30.562 --> 27:32.562
Compared to my husband, he's nothing.

27:35.562 --> 27:37.395
Can't he get hit by lightning?

27:38.311 --> 27:41.145
Pointy umbrella in a thunderstorm...

27:56.019 --> 27:58.478
Choi Sun-chul

28:33.728 --> 28:36.061
Sure, it's fabulous!

28:37.769 --> 28:40.019
Try living there just one week.

28:43.019 --> 28:45.727
An apartment can't even compare!

28:49.936 --> 28:52.561
Come on, the ferry runs so often!

28:55.186 --> 28:56.437
I'm telling you.

28:57.061 --> 29:00.936
I know that, but it's so quiet there.

29:01.437 --> 29:03.395
Air's clean, it's fabulous.

29:05.270 --> 29:07.853
Even more fabulous at night...

29:20.978 --> 29:21.853
Right.

29:24.936 --> 29:26.769
No, there aren't any!

29:27.686 --> 29:31.894
If you're scared, we'll raise chickens.
They eat snakes.

29:33.145 --> 29:34.145
What?

29:34.686 --> 29:36.686
Listen, honey...

29:38.145 --> 29:40.686
For once, at least come for a barbecue!

29:41.894 --> 29:45.228
Pork! Who roasts snakes?

29:48.936 --> 29:51.145
No alcohol, of course.

30:29.477 --> 30:30.727
Weight lifting?

30:35.769 --> 30:37.270
Honey! Honey!

30:43.978 --> 30:46.269
Even if this guy disappears,

30:46.270 --> 30:48.436
it's not like I can take his place.

30:49.644 --> 30:50.602
Right?

30:52.061 --> 30:54.019
What's so great about that spot?

31:03.644 --> 31:06.186
The competition for the place
will be fierce.

31:06.769 --> 31:09.103
Actually, it is a pretty nice spot.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.561
Lots of sun, nice breeze.

31:12.145 --> 31:13.270
Right...

31:14.769 --> 31:17.353
How many other candidates will there be?

31:18.519 --> 31:19.727
Ten people?

31:23.644 --> 31:24.686
Five?

31:27.477 --> 31:29.352
Moon Paper

31:29.686 --> 31:30.727
Four?

31:37.644 --> 31:40.145
Sell me this.
How much do you want?

32:02.394 --> 32:03.935
This is Pulp Men.

32:03.936 --> 32:06.228
Is this the advertising division?

32:07.103 --> 32:07.936
Hey.

32:08.352 --> 32:11.186
At least give me
those pajamas to wash.

32:11.769 --> 32:13.769
And take a shower this century!

32:15.310 --> 32:17.477
And will you let our pear tree die?

32:17.644 --> 32:19.644
Bugs are swarming all over it.

32:20.686 --> 32:23.394
Hey! You want me dead, too?

32:39.310 --> 32:41.061
Too drunk to feel pain?

32:41.310 --> 32:44.268
You're practically paralyzed!

32:44.269 --> 32:47.061
It's because of all those bugs.

32:47.436 --> 32:50.103
So what I'm asking is...

32:50.811 --> 32:52.728
You're the bug!

32:53.769 --> 32:57.894
...please give me a drop of remedy.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.103
I'll be back late.

33:01.477 --> 33:03.394
I have a meeting after the audition!

33:17.310 --> 33:19.477
Paper is our life!

33:19.936 --> 33:24.644
A master's degree in paper
or chemical engineering is required.

33:25.061 --> 33:26.477
Japanese speakers preferred.

33:27.103 --> 33:29.852
We at Red Pepper Paper,

33:29.853 --> 33:33.935
together with European and Japanese firms

33:33.936 --> 33:37.686
are launching a three-company
joint venture in Korea.

33:38.894 --> 33:44.727
Our goal is to be the top boutique factory
in specialized security paper.

33:45.352 --> 33:48.935
We seek family, not cogs in a machine.

33:48.936 --> 33:52.268
Tell us about your hobbies,
personality and family.

33:52.269 --> 33:55.435
Give us a photo
as large and recent as possible.

33:55.436 --> 33:58.977
Send it to P.O. Box 76,
Gujong City Central Post Office.

33:58.978 --> 34:01.393
We firmly reject applications by internet.

34:01.394 --> 34:03.936
If we don't use paper, who will?

34:08.019 --> 34:10.309
My name is Gu Bummo.

34:10.811 --> 34:12.936
As a resolutely analogue person,

34:13.227 --> 34:16.726
I play music only on vinyl,
take photos only on film,

34:16.727 --> 34:18.810
and write letters only on paper.

34:20.519 --> 34:24.102
My bond to paper, as durable
as reinforced synthetic paper,

34:24.103 --> 34:26.936
began before I was even born.

34:27.769 --> 34:30.726
Encouraged by my uncle,
a first generation paper man,

34:30.727 --> 34:33.686
I enrolled in paper manufacturing
at Kangwon University.

34:35.185 --> 34:38.935
After serving in the Marines,
I joined Namsun Paper in 1999.

34:39.853 --> 34:43.560
In 2013, I oversaw
the reinforced paper line

34:43.561 --> 34:46.769
with most of our customers
coming from the defense industry.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.269
Winning Pulp Man of the Year in 2018...

34:51.685 --> 34:53.309
“To Red Pepper Paper HR”

34:53.310 --> 34:55.519
...was the pinnacle of my career,

34:56.185 --> 34:59.018
but in 2023 the Defense Ministry
had a change in strategy

34:59.019 --> 35:00.936
causing our production line to close.

35:01.602 --> 35:04.978
Namsun Paper merged with Mori Paper,

35:05.394 --> 35:09.018
and all specialty paper personnel
such as myself

35:09.019 --> 35:11.269
had to leave the company.

35:12.103 --> 35:16.185
I've now been 8 months between jobs,

35:16.644 --> 35:19.436
and I feel my batteries
are completely charged.

35:20.436 --> 35:22.060
During my extensive free time,

35:22.061 --> 35:23.310
I...

36:06.602 --> 36:07.936
Pulp Man of the Year

36:08.185 --> 36:09.394
Fire Safety Certification

36:31.853 --> 36:34.352
Worked 2 years at Ishii Paper in Japan

37:07.769 --> 37:08.393
North Korea Type 64 Pistol

37:08.394 --> 37:09.477
One,

37:11.728 --> 37:12.811
two,

37:14.978 --> 37:16.144
three men...

39:11.394 --> 39:12.853
How was your day?

39:17.519 --> 39:19.018
Daddy's day was hard.

39:20.519 --> 39:23.352
There's this house with
a beautiful pear tree,

39:24.561 --> 39:26.727
but bugs are eating it alive.

39:28.561 --> 39:30.144
It made me sad.

39:35.644 --> 39:40.728
In these circumstances,
we can't afford to feed so many mouths.

39:58.394 --> 39:59.977
Oh, fuck!

40:28.018 --> 40:30.102
Eating any old mushroom again!

40:30.436 --> 40:33.018
You quit drinking,
and now you'll eat anything?

40:35.310 --> 40:37.269
My back will ache without a blanket.

40:39.728 --> 40:40.977
Why would you lie down?

40:42.269 --> 40:43.436
Not scared of a snake?

40:52.728 --> 40:55.185
They haven't called for an interview.

40:55.477 --> 40:56.728
They'll call.

40:57.310 --> 40:58.769
Do like me.

40:59.893 --> 41:01.017
What?

41:01.018 --> 41:04.394
Wrap the sunlight in wind
and take a bite.

41:04.686 --> 41:07.394
With a dollop of foliage.

41:09.561 --> 41:12.519
I've always at least gotten an interview.

41:15.102 --> 41:16.185
What about me?

41:19.018 --> 41:21.310
I failed my audition again!

41:22.893 --> 41:25.309
My skin's too firm

41:25.310 --> 41:28.144
to play a woman wailing
over her husband's death.

41:31.144 --> 41:34.728
Still, it was nice being at
the Arts Center after so long.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.810
Remember the night of the blackout?

41:41.352 --> 41:42.768
Our first play seen together.

41:43.310 --> 41:45.268
In Act 2, suddenly the lights go out.

41:45.269 --> 41:48.768
People panic, women scream,

41:50.144 --> 41:52.351
and I was about to have a panic attack,

41:52.352 --> 41:53.851
when you appeared.

41:53.852 --> 41:55.685
Suddenly, from who knows where,

41:55.686 --> 41:57.726
like a streetlight turning on,

41:57.727 --> 41:58.977
your face...

42:01.269 --> 42:06.269
Please light a flame

42:08.686 --> 42:12.727
in my lonely heart...

42:13.060 --> 42:14.269
Smiling,

42:15.060 --> 42:16.602
you lead me to the door.

42:16.935 --> 42:20.018
“Ara, follow me. Only me.”

42:21.893 --> 42:23.018
“Watch your step.”

42:26.018 --> 42:27.102
“Are you okay?”

42:28.227 --> 42:30.977
I was at my most innocent then.

42:32.893 --> 42:34.644
Plump and pretty.

42:35.436 --> 42:37.727
I let you have my first kiss.

42:44.144 --> 42:45.810
Remember what you said?

42:49.310 --> 42:53.602
“Ara, your lips are softer than
the highest quality Okamoto

42:54.810 --> 42:55.852
tracing paper.”

42:56.852 --> 42:58.518
Akimoto.

42:58.519 --> 43:00.185
Okamoto is a condom brand.

43:01.394 --> 43:02.934
“Ara, your lips

43:02.935 --> 43:06.310
are softer than the highest quality
Akimoto tracing paper.”

43:15.810 --> 43:18.519
No message, no email.

43:18.768 --> 43:20.685
Paper, paper! Damned paper!

43:21.269 --> 43:24.059
My dad kept offering to
set you up with a café,

43:24.060 --> 43:25.852
but no, it had to be paper!

43:26.394 --> 43:30.643
Even if they hire you,
you'll retire in 6-7 years. What then?

43:31.060 --> 43:32.726
In an age of living to 100?

43:32.727 --> 43:35.017
You with your nice audio system,

43:35.018 --> 43:37.185
you could earn even more
with a music café!

43:37.602 --> 43:39.060
Know how I feel lately?

43:39.977 --> 43:43.519
I want to run through the mountains,
wailing like a madwoman!

43:45.185 --> 43:48.601
I'm like one of your precious
paper machines.

43:48.601 --> 43:50.435
Neglect me, and I'll break!

43:50.436 --> 43:53.852
Hurry up and smother me in that lube oil!

43:54.519 --> 43:58.477
Or I'll rip you to pieces.
Like tracing paper!

43:59.810 --> 44:01.935
Paper has fed me for 25 years.

44:03.102 --> 44:04.060
Honey.

44:05.018 --> 44:07.643
It's how I'm meant to be,
I've no other choice.

44:07.977 --> 44:10.852
You've been fed by the money
I earned from paper, too.

44:11.768 --> 44:13.810
That money was printed on paper I made,

44:14.185 --> 44:16.810
and the cigarette filter
you smoke is paper, too.

44:18.685 --> 44:20.934
If we don't use paper, who will?

44:20.935 --> 44:21.643
What?

44:23.768 --> 44:25.601
They won't send a text or email.

44:26.269 --> 44:27.767
The mailbox! The mailbox!

44:27.768 --> 44:28.394
Hey!

44:28.852 --> 44:29.519
Hey!

44:31.227 --> 44:33.269
I'm through with you!

44:33.685 --> 44:34.519
You...

44:35.519 --> 44:37.977
As useless as scrap paper!

44:40.102 --> 44:41.643
Sorry to keep you waiting.

44:43.144 --> 44:47.477
- I'll check before the doctor comes.
- Yes.

44:49.436 --> 44:50.768
You're a nurse?

44:51.560 --> 44:54.310
Dental hygienist. It's different.

44:56.726 --> 44:58.976
Don't you have dance class now?

44:58.977 --> 45:01.102
My tooth hurts too much.

45:02.436 --> 45:04.269
Then say “ah”.

45:07.144 --> 45:09.352
You'll come to the dance party, though?

45:10.227 --> 45:12.684
How can I? I quit the lessons.

45:12.685 --> 45:15.892
You can still come! Ask the teacher.

45:15.893 --> 45:17.809
Ms. Lee, go on home.

45:17.810 --> 45:19.476
You need to pick up Ri-one.

45:19.477 --> 45:20.310
Yes.

45:21.436 --> 45:25.725
You were a thing pure,
noble, honest, without stain!

45:25.726 --> 45:27.600
And now – oh!

45:27.601 --> 45:31.059
When I think that I made
of a man like you my ideal!

45:31.060 --> 45:33.810
Dear me! The ideal of my life!

45:37.144 --> 45:38.477
Fucking snake!

45:42.185 --> 45:43.935
Was its head triangle-shaped?

45:44.893 --> 45:47.518
Then it's a cannibal viper.
It'll eat its own mother.

45:48.685 --> 45:50.934
Or was it a black-and-white pattern?

45:50.935 --> 45:54.309
Then it's a 7-step mamushi.
You'll die before taking 7 steps.

45:54.310 --> 45:56.185
I think I heard a rattle, too.

45:57.518 --> 46:00.185
Keep the bite wound
higher than your heart.

46:04.269 --> 46:05.768
Shouldn't it be lower?

46:06.810 --> 46:10.352
Don't worry. I did this in a play once.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.601
Did what?

46:38.935 --> 46:40.601
- Honey, know what?
- Listen...

46:41.060 --> 46:42.517
A snake just bit me.

46:42.518 --> 46:44.768
- What?
- Might be poisonous, I'll call you back.

47:00.018 --> 47:02.810
Chase the snakes away like this.

47:03.727 --> 47:04.726
Damn it!

47:05.310 --> 47:08.685
1. Keep bite lower than heart.
2. Don't cut, or suck out poison.

47:10.643 --> 47:11.727
For god's sake!

47:12.685 --> 47:14.394
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

47:14.935 --> 47:15.810
It's okay.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.935
If it were poisonous, I'd be dead now.

47:29.352 --> 47:30.435
What's with you?

47:34.018 --> 47:35.977
About the dance party...

47:36.393 --> 47:40.475
We better not go, right?
We quit the lessons.

47:40.476 --> 47:43.269
What? But we practiced so much.

47:46.935 --> 47:49.184
It's from the first mixtape you gave me.

47:49.185 --> 47:52.518
For a guy who only listens to '80s rock.

47:53.018 --> 47:54.810
I was blinded by love.

47:55.476 --> 47:58.018
I think I was prettiest back then.

47:58.351 --> 48:00.809
Even if I was a divorcee with a kid.

48:00.810 --> 48:02.810
Hey, don't talk like that.

48:03.144 --> 48:05.852
Of course, I earned more money than you.

48:07.060 --> 48:08.018
What?

48:08.351 --> 48:11.060
You think I proposed
because of your paycheck?

48:11.393 --> 48:14.060
Who knows? I had a college degree too.

48:15.269 --> 48:17.310
- So did I.
- Not back then.

48:19.601 --> 48:21.601
You're so mean. Forget it.

48:22.185 --> 48:25.809
You were busy doing
the distance degree while working.

48:25.810 --> 48:28.184
I wanted so much
to have fun with you then.

48:28.185 --> 48:31.517
Apologize, will you? Right now.

48:31.518 --> 48:32.560
You're right.

48:33.102 --> 48:38.102
Let's have 10 times more fun now
instead of wasting time complaining.

48:39.310 --> 48:41.227
When should we tell Si-one?

48:42.227 --> 48:43.476
Tell him what?

48:44.060 --> 48:47.144
We agreed to tell him
when he's old enough to shave.

48:48.518 --> 48:50.560
But do we have to tell him?

48:51.560 --> 48:54.102
I've been his dad since he was 2,
so I'm his dad.

48:59.727 --> 49:01.102
I'm sorry, Miri.

49:02.060 --> 49:05.727
You must want some lube oil too.
I've been so—

49:07.018 --> 49:08.560
Lube oil?

49:10.185 --> 49:11.476
It's not that.

49:12.601 --> 49:16.393
I've just been so busy these days
with job interviews.

49:17.102 --> 49:19.060
Does it have to be paper?

49:19.560 --> 49:21.227
How about some other job?

49:22.518 --> 49:23.601
What?

49:24.268 --> 49:25.351
Like a café?

49:26.560 --> 49:27.935
Why a café?

49:29.060 --> 49:31.768
Paper has fed me for 25 years, honey.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.601
It's how I'm meant to be.

49:35.518 --> 49:36.518
Think about it,

49:36.935 --> 49:40.476
would you tell a cannibal viper to
live off pear leaves?

49:40.852 --> 49:43.393
It's meant to eat its mother.

49:46.893 --> 49:50.102
- Is that so, Mr. You?
- Yes.

49:50.309 --> 49:52.060
- Mr. You.
- Yes?

49:52.435 --> 49:53.768
You're not a bad dancer.

49:54.685 --> 49:56.268
Follow me. Only me.

49:57.476 --> 50:00.018
Guess you overdid the vibrato.

50:16.102 --> 50:18.393
This will be the best job interview ever.

50:18.726 --> 50:20.185
Slay them all!

50:20.810 --> 50:23.185
Okay, I'll slay them all.

50:23.351 --> 50:24.768
Green light!

50:57.893 --> 50:59.060
Chun-oh!

50:59.935 --> 51:01.184
Chun-oh!

51:07.435 --> 51:12.267
Doing it on your bed is great, ma'am.
It doesn't even creak.

51:12.268 --> 51:14.892
Don't call me ma'am!

51:14.893 --> 51:18.060
Tell your husband not to quit

51:19.018 --> 51:22.102
that group for quitting drinking.
This is great.

52:00.977 --> 52:02.226
Minsan City...

52:22.309 --> 52:25.434
Hello, this is Red Pepper Paper.

52:25.435 --> 52:26.727
Oh, hello!

52:27.351 --> 52:29.183
- Hey, don't!
- What?

52:29.184 --> 52:31.393
Yes? Hello? What was that?

52:31.977 --> 52:33.393
I'm having trouble hearing you.

52:34.268 --> 52:35.559
I can hear you fine.

52:35.560 --> 52:38.143
I heard well from the spot
where you first answered.

52:39.018 --> 52:42.268
I see! I'm heading there now.

52:42.435 --> 52:43.268
Stop!

52:43.518 --> 52:45.018
That spot is perfect.

52:46.060 --> 52:47.725
You can hear best from here?

52:47.726 --> 52:49.685
Yes, I can hear you great now.

52:50.476 --> 52:53.852
By any chance are you
at your home in Minsan City?

52:54.726 --> 52:55.600
I am.

52:55.601 --> 52:57.685
My boss would like to meet you.

52:58.476 --> 53:01.101
He's very curious about you, Mr. Gu.

53:01.768 --> 53:03.142
- However...
- Yes?

53:03.143 --> 53:07.935
My boss is returning to Zurich
on a 5pm flight.

53:08.977 --> 53:14.101
I'm sorry, but if you leave from Minsan
right now, you should have time.

53:15.685 --> 53:16.726
Right now?

53:17.018 --> 53:18.977
Guess it's too much to ask?

53:20.018 --> 53:23.600
Okay, then I'll tell him you're not—

53:23.601 --> 53:25.143
No, no!

53:25.685 --> 53:26.560
I can go.

53:27.059 --> 53:29.476
Of course! I'll go.

53:29.852 --> 53:31.643
Then I'll text you right now

53:31.935 --> 53:35.267
with the address of our office,
so please set off now.

53:35.268 --> 53:36.935
Of course, yes.

53:40.435 --> 53:43.851
I'll just change clothes quickly and go.

53:43.852 --> 53:45.183
Text me the address!

53:45.184 --> 53:47.184
No, no! You're fine as you—

54:47.685 --> 54:48.809
Bitch...

54:48.810 --> 54:51.685
No New Messages

55:02.893 --> 55:04.101
Please answer...

55:12.810 --> 55:13.976
Come on, pick up.

55:34.852 --> 55:37.934
Hey, how are you? Busy?

55:38.643 --> 55:39.643
Bad reception?

55:40.685 --> 55:43.226
No way! The signal's best here.

55:44.101 --> 55:45.268
You hear me, right?

55:45.810 --> 55:50.268
Well, I went to some gathering
without seeing that it got cancelled.

55:50.726 --> 55:53.685
So I came back early,
and now I'm feeling so bored.

55:55.017 --> 55:55.768
My wife?

55:57.435 --> 55:58.226
Not sure.

56:00.643 --> 56:01.726
Maybe she went out.

56:04.601 --> 56:06.435
Want to catch up over a drink?

56:08.017 --> 56:13.143
I quit, sure, but now it's under control.
I can drink reasonably.

56:15.601 --> 56:16.435
Exactly!

56:17.685 --> 56:19.768
See you at the fried chicken place.

56:20.768 --> 56:24.143
Come when you finish work.
I'll wait there.

56:38.017 --> 56:40.435
Oh Chin-ho's Dental Clinic

56:43.268 --> 56:44.726
- Hello.
- Yeah.

56:50.726 --> 56:52.351
- Hi Ri-one.
- You're late.

57:03.184 --> 57:04.726
I'll throw it out.

57:05.268 --> 57:06.309
Thank you.

57:10.934 --> 57:13.851
I waited to say hello to you.
I'm Oh Chin-ho.

57:14.518 --> 57:16.058
You've got a bad toothache?

57:16.059 --> 57:16.643
Yeah.

57:16.976 --> 57:18.017
Stop by some time.

57:19.143 --> 57:21.727
- Could you lower the window?
- I'm okay.

57:21.976 --> 57:23.643
I'm totally fine, Mr. Oh Chun-oh.

57:25.476 --> 57:28.351
Thank you, Doctor Oh. Chin. Ho.

57:28.643 --> 57:29.351
Thanks!

57:30.101 --> 57:31.184
Go home now.

57:36.892 --> 57:38.351
Goddamned embarrassing...

57:44.809 --> 57:47.517
Ri-one, it's okay now.

57:47.518 --> 57:50.435
Dad's not a very
smooth driver, that's all.

57:51.393 --> 57:54.309
He's young. Quite an age gap.

57:55.101 --> 57:55.934
Age gap?

57:57.809 --> 57:58.684
With who?

57:58.685 --> 58:01.226
I'd rather you not
talk to that man about me.

58:28.643 --> 58:30.476
It may be

58:31.017 --> 58:34.059
that I'm still just a child

58:35.351 --> 58:36.976
It seems so

58:37.435 --> 58:41.017
Mom, why do I

58:41.601 --> 58:45.101
keep waiting for you?

58:45.851 --> 58:49.143
Mom, why do I

58:50.101 --> 58:53.725
suddenly miss you so?

58:54.309 --> 58:55.851
It may be

58:56.435 --> 58:59.560
that I'm still just a child

59:00.560 --> 59:02.268
It seems so

59:02.725 --> 59:06.226
Mom, why do I

59:06.892 --> 59:10.560
keep feeling sad?

59:11.101 --> 59:14.683
Mom, why do I...

59:14.684 --> 59:16.934
The two of us can't live
under the same sky.

59:22.226 --> 59:23.309
Want to end this with a duel?

59:25.393 --> 59:27.184
Does Ara know you're doing this,

59:27.601 --> 59:29.143
newcomer actor Lee Chun-oh?

59:29.560 --> 59:30.268
Who?

59:30.684 --> 59:31.976
Were you baking,

59:32.184 --> 59:33.184
and suddenly,

59:33.851 --> 59:35.976
decided you want Ara all to yourself?

59:38.560 --> 59:39.560
Exactly!

59:47.601 --> 59:51.100
With my heart steeped in loneliness

59:51.101 --> 59:54.559
I gaze up at the sky,

59:54.560 --> 59:58.809
and the clouds flow past

59:59.726 --> 01:00:01.517
making me dizzy

01:00:01.518 --> 01:00:04.933
Making my head spin

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:08.100
as the red dragonfly flies off...

01:00:08.101 --> 01:00:08.851
Sorry.

01:00:10.934 --> 01:00:11.976
But you must disappear

01:00:13.184 --> 01:00:14.017
for me to live.

01:00:29.101 --> 01:00:29.851
Know your place!

01:00:30.143 --> 01:00:32.351
The man Ara loves is me!

01:00:38.518 --> 01:00:39.351
You sure?

01:00:39.892 --> 01:00:40.351
What!

01:00:40.809 --> 01:00:42.184
Can't an unemployed man love?

01:00:42.892 --> 01:00:43.892
That's not it!

01:00:44.726 --> 01:00:46.184
That's not it at all, but...

01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:47.600
You...

01:00:50.226 --> 01:00:50.726
did not...

01:00:51.518 --> 01:00:53.518
even listen to

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.518
your wife's sensible suggestions!

01:00:55.976 --> 01:00:56.642
Damn, my throat.

01:00:58.226 --> 01:00:59.268
What's wrong with a music café?

01:01:05.435 --> 01:01:08.268
She even told you that?

01:01:11.184 --> 01:01:13.059
If you can't earn money, sell the house!

01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.435
Work at a retail store moving boxes!

01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:19.143
I'm an engineer!

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:20.725
An expert!

01:01:23.435 --> 01:01:24.017
The house...

01:01:25.184 --> 01:01:26.642
is Ara's father's, so I can't sell it.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:29.017
The boxes...

01:01:31.017 --> 01:01:32.934
hurt my back, so I can't lift them!

01:01:33.767 --> 01:01:34.809
You proud of that?

01:01:43.017 --> 01:01:44.600
If you found out, tell me!

01:01:44.976 --> 01:01:46.101
Why not say something?

01:02:05.017 --> 01:02:05.851
And if I do?

01:02:07.017 --> 01:02:08.641
Will you come back?

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:09.268
Huh?

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:11.309
Snake bite! You fucker!

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:18.809
Honey!

01:02:18.976 --> 01:02:19.517
Honey!

01:02:46.684 --> 01:02:48.017
You shithead!

01:03:10.725 --> 01:03:11.393
The gun!

01:03:12.351 --> 01:03:13.851
Give me the gun!

01:03:14.226 --> 01:03:15.600
I'm an ex-Marine!

01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:41.851
Losing my job

01:03:42.726 --> 01:03:44.891
is not my choice.

01:03:44.892 --> 01:03:46.684
How many times must I say it?

01:03:47.767 --> 01:03:50.725
Losing your job isn't the problem!

01:03:50.976 --> 01:03:56.309
The problem is how you deal with it!

01:04:02.226 --> 01:04:03.642
Oh, come on...

01:04:06.184 --> 01:04:08.143
You going to die from two bullets?

01:05:05.392 --> 01:05:07.475
Ms. Wife – 10 missed calls

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:13.349
Fucking...

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.934
...hell!

01:05:23.184 --> 01:05:25.017
These ones sell for a lot.

01:05:27.934 --> 01:05:28.517
Yep?

01:05:28.976 --> 01:05:30.642
Why won't your mom pick up?

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.350
Dunno.

01:05:33.226 --> 01:05:34.892
- Is Mom home?
- Nope.

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:37.684
Did she leave any message?

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:42.517
Your dad is going to regret this!

01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:45.226
Your dad is going to regret this!

01:05:48.767 --> 01:05:50.725
Why? Where'd she go?

01:05:57.226 --> 01:05:59.891
- Did Mom leave me a costume?
- Yep.

01:05:59.892 --> 01:06:04.184
Can't you answer me in full sentences?

01:06:05.059 --> 01:06:06.475
Good luck, Dad!

01:06:06.851 --> 01:06:07.892
Thanks!

01:06:28.101 --> 01:06:29.226
Let's dance.

01:06:30.726 --> 01:06:32.226
You don't know the dance.

01:06:32.559 --> 01:06:34.392
Sure I know it.

01:06:35.475 --> 01:06:37.143
I memorized it, watching now.

01:06:38.226 --> 01:06:39.767
You said you practiced a lot.

01:06:41.143 --> 01:06:42.517
Got to show it off.

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:11.725
Greetings. That way.

01:07:16.101 --> 01:07:18.933
Don't you believe me?

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:20.349
No, I don't!

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.725
I'm a bullfighter today,
so a pretty bull... no, cow.

01:07:23.642 --> 01:07:24.976
Nice!

01:07:38.143 --> 01:07:39.851
Care for a cocktail?

01:09:32.892 --> 01:09:35.058
Welcome to Gujong City

01:09:53.934 --> 01:09:55.517
Did you fuck in the car?

01:09:57.976 --> 01:09:59.350
You like it in the car.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.017
You wore the black fishnet panties?
Rose lace?

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.308
I searched, and they're missing.

01:10:09.475 --> 01:10:10.642
What are you doing?

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.225
You're wearing them!

01:10:14.684 --> 01:10:16.350
You are! Take them off.

01:10:16.684 --> 01:10:19.976
If I smell them,
I'll know if you fucked him or not.

01:10:21.809 --> 01:10:23.392
It'll just take a second!

01:10:24.183 --> 01:10:26.225
If you're innocent,
what are you scared of?

01:10:35.434 --> 01:10:36.517
Did you drink?

01:10:40.767 --> 01:10:42.434
You can't!

01:10:43.642 --> 01:10:45.726
We can't go through that again!

01:10:46.517 --> 01:10:48.016
Nine years!

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:50.934
You've held back nine years,
gritting your teeth.

01:10:51.142 --> 01:10:52.600
Has it gone up in smoke?

01:10:52.892 --> 01:10:55.224
Puking in your sleep, almost suffocating!

01:10:55.225 --> 01:10:56.350
Getting drunk and...

01:10:57.308 --> 01:11:00.851
beating my 5-year old son.
Saying he's jealous of your daughter!

01:11:01.726 --> 01:11:03.225
I've said it a million times.

01:11:03.934 --> 01:11:05.726
Si-one is my kid, too.

01:11:06.267 --> 01:11:07.183
Sure enough.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.434
You don't discriminate.
You're a dog to everyone when drunk.

01:11:37.392 --> 01:11:39.016
What were you thinking?

01:11:40.058 --> 01:11:42.057
Matching your costume with Dr. Ouch.

01:11:42.058 --> 01:11:44.475
Dressing me up as a goddamn Nutcracker!

01:11:49.517 --> 01:11:50.892
John Smith!

01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:57.267
British Admiral John Smith and
Pocahontas, you idiot!

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.057
Ri-one's favorite cartoon!

01:12:00.058 --> 01:12:02.559
You forgot?
We watched it a million times with her!

01:12:03.475 --> 01:12:05.850
When I told Dr. Oh I'd be Pocahontas,

01:12:05.851 --> 01:12:08.684
the whole clinic decided to be
Native Americans!

01:12:09.016 --> 01:12:11.474
The nurse there was dressed as one, too!

01:12:11.475 --> 01:12:15.267
You and I were meant to be a pair!

01:12:16.891 --> 01:12:18.809
You think I'm that kind of person?

01:12:19.183 --> 01:12:21.100
How can you suspect me?

01:12:21.475 --> 01:12:23.433
Sure I can suspect you!

01:12:23.434 --> 01:12:25.809
You're pretty!
You're so damned pretty!

01:12:26.183 --> 01:12:27.434
You're handsome, too!

01:12:30.975 --> 01:12:33.308
What's this? Who did this?

01:12:37.225 --> 01:12:39.891
I'm fighting a war,
for our family.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.600
So we need to band together
and believe each other.

01:12:46.392 --> 01:12:47.142
Loyalty.

01:12:47.726 --> 01:12:48.559
Trust.

01:12:50.225 --> 01:12:52.767
Then why lock yourself in the greenhouse?

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.225
That damned greenhouse!

01:12:55.767 --> 01:12:59.933
And driving 3000 km in a month!

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:02.183
Why bring rubber pants?

01:13:02.684 --> 01:13:05.266
How can you get a snakebite
at a job interview?

01:13:05.267 --> 01:13:08.057
How stupid do you think I am?

01:13:08.058 --> 01:13:09.642
Tell me! Who is she?

01:13:10.225 --> 01:13:12.182
The bitch you go fishing
and eat chicken with,

01:13:12.183 --> 01:13:14.392
having sex smothered in lube oil!

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.850
Honey, don't do this to me.

01:13:19.058 --> 01:13:20.642
My job interviews,

01:13:21.767 --> 01:13:24.475
they're really difficult interviews.

01:13:25.392 --> 01:13:27.933
Looking someone right in the eye...

01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:32.016
Doing that is really hard.

01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:38.308
You don't deny it?

01:14:02.183 --> 01:14:04.183
Drink with colleagues, work talk

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:07.475
How is this?

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.766
This is a softer material.

01:14:10.767 --> 01:14:12.225
Not really.

01:14:17.933 --> 01:14:18.975
Just a moment.

01:14:19.642 --> 01:14:21.349
Yeni, what is it?

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:24.559
Can I hang out with my friends
after art lessons?

01:14:28.475 --> 01:14:31.516
- Min's dad will drive you?
- Yes.

01:14:31.517 --> 01:14:32.933
These are no good, either.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.517
Yes, just a minute.

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:36.975
I have a pair that you'll like.

01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:40.725
Go on, go!

01:14:42.475 --> 01:14:44.015
It's a brand new item, so—

01:14:44.016 --> 01:14:45.057
Never mind, mister.

01:14:45.058 --> 01:14:45.808
Wait.

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.765
Just a second.

01:14:49.766 --> 01:14:51.684
Don't go yet.

01:14:55.434 --> 01:14:59.183
Headquarters only sends us a few pairs.

01:14:59.933 --> 01:15:01.350
Just a moment.

01:15:02.434 --> 01:15:03.684
I'll be right there.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.016
Sir!

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.600
So the other man left?

01:15:19.392 --> 01:15:20.392
Seems so.

01:15:21.933 --> 01:15:23.559
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:15:24.392 --> 01:15:26.142
Shoes for yourself?

01:15:26.725 --> 01:15:27.766
Or a gift?

01:15:29.267 --> 01:15:30.765
I've got a daughter, too.

01:15:30.766 --> 01:15:32.350
How old is she?

01:15:34.434 --> 01:15:35.350
Come in.

01:15:56.434 --> 01:15:57.642
You miss it, right?

01:15:58.517 --> 01:16:01.016
Having a drink with colleagues,
talking about work?

01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:05.766
It's been over a year for me too,

01:16:06.392 --> 01:16:09.058
so I recognize
an unemployed comrade at once.

01:16:10.392 --> 01:16:12.642
You don't look like a man for this job.

01:16:14.933 --> 01:16:16.100
Ten years old.

01:16:17.434 --> 01:16:18.600
Your daughter!

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.182
What kind of shoes?

01:16:21.183 --> 01:16:22.600
Boots? Sandals?

01:16:23.559 --> 01:16:26.267
- Enamel shoes. Quite shiny.
- Yes.

01:16:26.808 --> 01:16:28.475
I worked in the paper industry.

01:16:29.225 --> 01:16:30.308
Specialty paper.

01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:33.559
We made banknotes, lottery tickets...

01:16:34.559 --> 01:16:36.682
invoices, passports,
ice cream cone sleeves,

01:16:36.683 --> 01:16:39.765
menstrual pad release paper,
cigarette filters...

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:41.766
People laugh when I say this,

01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:48.600
but for those of us who make it,
white paper is a kind of art.

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:51.766
Why laugh?

01:16:52.308 --> 01:16:54.517
That feeling of touching fine paper

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.100
is so comforting.

01:16:58.559 --> 01:17:00.559
You've got fine senses, I see.

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.142
My daughter hardly ever speaks.

01:17:05.891 --> 01:17:09.350
When she does,
it's to echo others' words.

01:17:11.683 --> 01:17:15.100
She was born that way.
She only plays cello.

01:17:16.808 --> 01:17:18.599
Her teacher says she's gifted.

01:17:19.475 --> 01:17:22.641
Might even become world famous.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:26.724
But she won't play for us.

01:17:27.808 --> 01:17:30.641
As parents, we should support her talent,

01:17:32.142 --> 01:17:35.016
because without music
she'll never be independent.

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:40.683
Her teacher said she needs
to be playing on a $50,000 cello.

01:17:41.434 --> 01:17:44.100
She'll give a recital this Christmas,

01:17:44.808 --> 01:17:48.392
but she only has rain boots.

01:17:49.517 --> 01:17:53.183
I can't buy her an instrument,
at least I'll get her shoes.

01:17:53.808 --> 01:17:54.933
Wait.

01:17:56.183 --> 01:18:00.557
Her lesson finishes soon.
Maybe I'll bring her to try them on.

01:18:00.558 --> 01:18:01.765
When do you close?

01:18:01.766 --> 01:18:03.516
You can come any time before 7.

01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:05.807
Her lesson won't finish by 7.

01:18:05.808 --> 01:18:07.599
It takes me an hour to clean up.

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:09.641
I'll wait, then.

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:10.933
8 o'clock!

01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:18.641
I can only get a commission
if you buy through me.

01:18:19.183 --> 01:18:20.142
Yes.

01:18:39.933 --> 01:18:41.058
No other choice.

01:18:42.558 --> 01:18:43.850
No other choice.

01:18:44.183 --> 01:18:45.516
No other choice.

01:18:45.725 --> 01:18:47.058
No other choice.

01:18:47.683 --> 01:18:49.058
No other choice.

01:18:56.725 --> 01:18:58.599
What are you doing here?

01:18:58.933 --> 01:19:01.515
You haven't been able to
pick up your daughter?

01:19:01.516 --> 01:19:04.933
Think it has to be towed.
It's so expensive, though.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.975
Then, the money for the shoes...

01:19:14.267 --> 01:19:16.099
I'm a machine repairman...

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:19.349
Let's see if my skills are any use.

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:22.516
My beloved Elantra, no less!

01:19:23.516 --> 01:19:26.434
My, without your glasses,
you look like a model.

01:19:28.599 --> 01:19:30.434
What have we got here?

01:19:36.725 --> 01:19:38.558
So this is on your way home.

01:19:45.308 --> 01:19:47.225
So this is it!

01:19:49.016 --> 01:19:50.183
Try starting—

01:21:10.058 --> 01:21:13.099
I will walk where my steps take me,

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:16.975
and let the rain wash away
these feelings of mine

01:21:22.599 --> 01:21:25.598
Endlessly, aimlessly

01:21:25.599 --> 01:21:29.349
my heart is floating
here and there in the rain

01:21:34.933 --> 01:21:38.015
The teddy bear lets out a laugh,

01:21:38.016 --> 01:21:41.015
the store lights let out a laugh

01:21:41.016 --> 01:21:43.974
I can't forget the shambles
of days gone by

01:21:43.975 --> 01:21:46.975
like the inside of a discarded bag

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:54.682
I will walk where my steps take me,

01:21:54.683 --> 01:21:58.142
and let the rain wash away
these feelings of mine

01:22:03.808 --> 01:22:06.724
Endlessly, aimlessly

01:22:06.725 --> 01:22:10.307
my heart is floating
here and there in the rain

01:22:16.016 --> 01:22:19.015
The passersby don't know,

01:22:19.016 --> 01:22:21.932
the lonely streetlights don't know,

01:22:21.933 --> 01:22:24.682
The dizzying mass of days long gone

01:22:24.683 --> 01:22:28.558
like a flower bed bursting
recklessly into bloom

01:22:32.391 --> 01:22:35.390
I will walk where my steps take me,

01:22:35.391 --> 01:22:39.100
and let the rain wash away
these feelings of mine

01:22:44.474 --> 01:22:47.306
Endlessly, aimlessly

01:22:47.307 --> 01:22:51.016
my heart is floating
here and there in the rain

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.142
Honey.

01:23:26.975 --> 01:23:27.808
Honey.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:28.933
Honey!

01:23:32.266 --> 01:23:33.599
The police are here.

01:23:39.266 --> 01:23:40.724
What should we do?

01:23:48.683 --> 01:23:50.516
Be sure not to panic, okay?

01:23:50.975 --> 01:23:52.474
I need to change clothes.

01:24:02.183 --> 01:24:04.142
I'll explain it all at the station.

01:24:06.058 --> 01:24:07.058
It's all my—

01:24:07.516 --> 01:24:08.683
You Si-one.

01:24:10.307 --> 01:24:11.641
What were you saying?

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:18.683
It's all my fault for being a bad father.

01:24:41.975 --> 01:24:43.724
You're the one who said not to panic!

01:24:46.725 --> 01:24:47.599
Get in!

01:24:50.725 --> 01:24:51.683
The door...

01:24:58.641 --> 01:25:00.808
Is Dongho's mom
not picking up on purpose?

01:25:02.182 --> 01:25:04.975
How could Dongho
rat on his friend like that?

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:09.141
It can't have been Si-one's idea.

01:25:09.433 --> 01:25:12.474
It's Dongho's dad's store.
So Dongho suggested it.

01:25:12.891 --> 01:25:14.099
Isn't it obvious?

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.599
Dongho's Mom

01:25:19.808 --> 01:25:23.058
He must be so lonely
and scared, my baby.

01:25:23.891 --> 01:25:25.307
This is all your fault!

01:25:29.474 --> 01:25:30.307
Excuse me!

01:25:33.766 --> 01:25:35.933
Just a minute! Wait!

01:25:37.307 --> 01:25:38.433
Hold on a minute!

01:25:39.683 --> 01:25:42.391
Listen, his mother is parking the car.

01:25:43.099 --> 01:25:46.432
Can we go in with him?
He's still just a kid.

01:25:46.433 --> 01:25:47.390
All right.

01:25:47.391 --> 01:25:48.266
Thank you.

01:25:49.891 --> 01:25:51.558
Lift your head. Look at me.

01:25:52.641 --> 01:25:55.641
Dongho dragged you into it, right?

01:25:56.349 --> 01:25:57.349
Dongho?

01:25:58.391 --> 01:25:59.807
Why would he drag me—

01:25:59.808 --> 01:26:02.433
Hey. Listen...

01:26:03.766 --> 01:26:08.391
Doing a crime on your own
is incredibly lonely and scary.

01:26:09.307 --> 01:26:11.266
That's how I imagine it, anyway.

01:26:13.808 --> 01:26:16.098
I'll never leave you to feel lonely.

01:26:16.099 --> 01:26:18.433
So, I need your cooperation.

01:26:18.766 --> 01:26:20.057
Since we're a team.

01:26:24.641 --> 01:26:26.890
Actually, the one who suggested it—

01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:29.849
Hey, hey, wait. Wait!

01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:31.015
Get a grip.

01:26:31.016 --> 01:26:32.141
Listen to me.

01:26:32.975 --> 01:26:35.391
Our family is in a war now.

01:26:35.766 --> 01:26:36.640
What?

01:26:36.641 --> 01:26:38.975
No, I don't mean with each other.

01:26:41.683 --> 01:26:46.766
You and me, in this war,
we need to protect our women, right?

01:26:46.975 --> 01:26:49.515
You know Grandpa's pistol?

01:26:49.516 --> 01:26:52.432
Your grandpa bent the fingers
of a dead Viet Cong

01:26:52.433 --> 01:26:54.933
and took that pistol, why do you think?

01:26:56.182 --> 01:27:02.224
To remember that if he hadn't shot first,
the enemy would've shot him with that gun.

01:27:03.307 --> 01:27:04.558
You get what I mean?

01:27:30.933 --> 01:27:32.766
All the men...

01:27:33.307 --> 01:27:35.641
What'll you do, huh?

01:27:45.057 --> 01:27:46.433
Let's wash your hands.

01:27:50.224 --> 01:27:51.307
Up you go!

01:27:57.599 --> 01:28:03.266
Dongho says Si-one wanted to sell
the phones and help out his mom. Damn!

01:28:06.516 --> 01:28:08.599
It's your own store.

01:28:09.182 --> 01:28:11.099
Let's put this behind us.

01:28:26.724 --> 01:28:29.641
If you don't settle,
he'll get a year's sentence.

01:28:30.391 --> 01:28:33.850
A mom can't let that happen to her son.

01:28:34.808 --> 01:28:35.850
Isn't that so?

01:28:40.599 --> 01:28:42.558
Hey, Man-su.

01:28:43.349 --> 01:28:44.391
Wonno.

01:28:44.932 --> 01:28:46.015
Gimme a smoke.

01:28:47.099 --> 01:28:48.099
Sure.

01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:51.391
What are you doing?

01:28:52.099 --> 01:28:54.099
I started smoking again.

01:29:01.099 --> 01:29:04.516
But honey, mind if I talk
to my friend for a sec?

01:29:05.599 --> 01:29:06.641
Just talk.

01:29:07.683 --> 01:29:09.141
You don't mind, do you?

01:29:10.808 --> 01:29:11.808
Well...

01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:22.683
Dongho dragged Si-one into it.
That's what Dongho will testify.

01:29:23.683 --> 01:29:25.433
Si-one just stood nearby.

01:29:26.099 --> 01:29:27.181
What a crock of shit!

01:29:27.182 --> 01:29:29.641
Dongho turned off the CCTV,

01:29:31.516 --> 01:29:32.890
but not the other one.

01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:37.390
He didn't know to turn off
the security system.

01:29:37.391 --> 01:29:39.724
What if your wife found out

01:29:39.725 --> 01:29:43.683
you use that store at night
as a place for fucking women?

01:29:43.849 --> 01:29:49.766
And if she heard you bragged about it
to all the men in the neighborhood?

01:29:50.307 --> 01:29:53.224
You jobless stinking piece of shit!

01:29:53.641 --> 01:29:55.266
I'll fucking kill you!

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:56.724
One more thing.

01:29:57.683 --> 01:29:59.099
You're not buying my home.

01:30:00.015 --> 01:30:01.266
Miri, let's go.

01:30:04.558 --> 01:30:05.849
Forget buying it.

01:30:06.266 --> 01:30:07.766
Honey, be careful.

01:30:14.307 --> 01:30:16.558
Are they up there?

01:30:16.808 --> 01:30:18.516
Are there many?

01:30:21.641 --> 01:30:22.474
How many?

01:30:24.641 --> 01:30:25.599
There's more?

01:30:28.683 --> 01:30:29.932
That brat...

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:32.683
Two, four, six...

01:30:36.099 --> 01:30:38.099
We don't have to give them back?

01:30:38.725 --> 01:30:40.391
Let's make them disappear.

01:30:40.932 --> 01:30:43.974
Wonno can't help but cover it up anyway.

01:30:44.391 --> 01:30:45.224
Right?

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:46.307
Of course.

01:31:01.266 --> 01:31:02.932
What tree will you plant?

01:31:03.433 --> 01:31:05.683
When the apples ripen, let's make jam.

01:31:06.683 --> 01:31:08.683
Will the roots grow over the phones?

01:31:09.057 --> 01:31:11.391
The tastiest things grow on filth.

01:31:11.849 --> 01:31:14.182
Fertilizer's made from shit and piss.

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:21.474
Okay, thank you.

01:31:23.599 --> 01:31:26.224
Is it true about Grandpa?

01:31:27.807 --> 01:31:29.683
He hung himself in this house?

01:31:33.849 --> 01:31:35.266
You know his pig farm?

01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:37.725
They caught a disease,

01:31:38.724 --> 01:31:41.474
and he had to kill them all,
20,000 pigs.

01:31:42.765 --> 01:31:43.806
How?

01:31:43.807 --> 01:31:45.558
He buried them, alive.

01:31:46.724 --> 01:31:49.433
But he was always a bit unstable.

01:31:49.807 --> 01:31:51.723
Ever since fighting in Vietnam.

01:31:52.307 --> 01:31:53.765
In the old barn, he...

01:31:54.099 --> 01:31:57.516
you know... but I didn't see it.

01:32:00.266 --> 01:32:01.433
Hey.

01:32:05.849 --> 01:32:06.932
Sit with me.

01:32:07.641 --> 01:32:08.641
Come closer.

01:32:17.474 --> 01:32:18.723
Mom doesn't know.

01:32:19.932 --> 01:32:21.182
Don't look, don't look!

01:32:23.349 --> 01:32:24.433
I quit.

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:28.141
Throw them out yourself.

01:36:04.974 --> 01:36:05.932
Papyrus...

01:36:07.182 --> 01:36:08.598
You interviewed there?

01:36:10.849 --> 01:36:11.807
I was rejected.

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:14.598
- The name Go Sijo—
- Never heard of it.

01:36:21.307 --> 01:36:22.557
And Gu Bummo?

01:36:29.974 --> 01:36:30.807
Not sure...

01:36:31.682 --> 01:36:33.974
We're visiting people
who interviewed there.

01:36:34.515 --> 01:36:36.432
Anything unusual happen recently?

01:36:36.807 --> 01:36:38.349
Have you felt in danger?

01:36:42.682 --> 01:36:45.057
Those two men have disappeared.

01:36:48.182 --> 01:36:49.765
You may think badly of me,

01:36:49.974 --> 01:36:51.974
but even after hearing they died,

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:57.472
the thought that comes to mind is,
I wonder what lucky person got hired?

01:36:57.473 --> 01:36:59.099
I said “disappeared”.

01:37:00.015 --> 01:37:00.849
Give me that.

01:37:01.307 --> 01:37:02.598
And then,

01:37:02.932 --> 01:37:08.723
Mr. You, you said to me,
“they died”.

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.099
Why do you think they're dead?

01:37:13.015 --> 01:37:14.266
Well...

01:37:15.765 --> 01:37:18.682
In today's world, if someone disappears,

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:20.266
then usually...

01:37:22.266 --> 01:37:27.723
“In today's world, if someone
disappears, then usually...”

01:37:28.015 --> 01:37:31.224
Go Sijo's wife reported him missing,

01:37:31.473 --> 01:37:35.473
and after tracking his phone,
we found his car sitting by itself.

01:37:35.682 --> 01:37:38.557
She said after being fired,
he was extremely depressed.

01:37:38.807 --> 01:37:39.681
Oh my.

01:37:39.682 --> 01:37:42.807
A phone contains
all of a person's life, right?

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:45.014
Who you talked to,

01:37:45.015 --> 01:37:47.557
and also, who you couldn't talk to.

01:37:48.349 --> 01:37:49.889
9 Missed Calls

01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:50.890
What the!

01:37:55.099 --> 01:37:57.307
It's that number! The missed calls.

01:37:58.141 --> 01:37:59.473
Umbrella.

01:38:00.765 --> 01:38:02.182
Finally, you answered.

01:38:02.598 --> 01:38:05.849
You've called the phone of a man
who's gone missing.

01:38:06.224 --> 01:38:08.099
Excuse me, but who are you?

01:38:09.348 --> 01:38:11.348
I'm head of HR at Papyrus.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.849
Mr. Go interviewed at our company,
and I called to say he was hired.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:17.765
This is like some kind of curse.

01:38:18.015 --> 01:38:18.640
What?

01:38:19.099 --> 01:38:25.515
We originally planned to hire a different
applicant but couldn't reach him, either.

01:38:25.807 --> 01:38:27.557
What was that man's name?

01:38:27.974 --> 01:38:31.682
That man... hold on, his name...

01:38:32.307 --> 01:38:33.722
He scored highest.

01:38:33.723 --> 01:38:36.432
Gu... Gu... Gu...

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.765
Bummo.

01:38:38.348 --> 01:38:41.640
And I knew I'd seen that name before.

01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:43.515
Gu Bummo

01:38:44.432 --> 01:38:45.682
Look, kiddo!

01:38:48.598 --> 01:38:50.515
They knew each other?

01:38:52.682 --> 01:38:55.306
So, there were two paper men.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:58.974
They knew each other.
And disappeared at the same time.

01:38:59.141 --> 01:39:01.640
We did a painstaking search
around the car.

01:39:01.932 --> 01:39:04.098
We found traces of Mr. Go's blood—

01:39:04.099 --> 01:39:04.849
Blood...

01:39:05.890 --> 01:39:10.473
And what might've caused
Mr. Go's blood to spill out of his veins?

01:39:11.266 --> 01:39:12.141
A gun.

01:39:12.306 --> 01:39:13.056
A handgun.

01:39:13.057 --> 01:39:14.306
Made in North Korea.

01:39:15.432 --> 01:39:16.724
A bullet shell was found.

01:39:17.182 --> 01:39:17.849
By me.

01:39:18.974 --> 01:39:19.974
A bullet shell!

01:39:25.765 --> 01:39:26.807
Pretty scary.

01:39:29.306 --> 01:39:33.224
Until I catch the culprit,
you must be very careful.

01:39:36.682 --> 01:39:37.932
Ri-one.

01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:40.473
What kid listens to such music?

01:39:42.015 --> 01:39:44.432
I'll contact you as soon as I go missing.

01:39:51.974 --> 01:39:54.765
This is not a joking matter.

01:39:55.598 --> 01:39:56.598
Drive safely!

01:39:57.515 --> 01:39:58.431
Ri-one!

01:39:58.432 --> 01:39:59.557
What are you doing?

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:05.724
What's wrong?

01:40:05.974 --> 01:40:07.390
My dear Ri-one...

01:40:08.890 --> 01:40:10.390
Don't cry... Don't cry.

01:40:12.182 --> 01:40:13.305
Don't cry.

01:40:13.306 --> 01:40:16.723
I'll bring them back, okay?
Stop crying.

01:40:19.265 --> 01:40:20.974
Just need to do one more.

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:23.807
25 years

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.724
After you left me,

01:40:45.473 --> 01:40:51.348
the hole you left in my chest
hurts me so much!

01:40:52.432 --> 01:40:56.390
Thinking I will die, I pray

01:40:57.390 --> 01:41:01.223
Please take this pain from me...

01:41:05.348 --> 01:41:06.765
What the fuck?

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.765
Mr. Choi Sun-chul?

01:41:10.223 --> 01:41:11.890
You thought I was a deer?

01:41:12.724 --> 01:41:14.472
- For fuck's sake.
- I waited all day.

01:41:14.473 --> 01:41:17.181
I'm You Man-su.

01:41:17.974 --> 01:41:21.390
I was manager of specialty paper
at Solar until they fired me.

01:41:26.306 --> 01:41:28.849
The guy from the restroom?

01:41:29.099 --> 01:41:32.515
I've got all this free time,
and I envy you so much,

01:41:32.723 --> 01:41:36.057
I've been watching
your Instagram every day.

01:41:36.515 --> 01:41:37.557
Whoa.

01:41:38.181 --> 01:41:39.849
You mean I'm being stalked?

01:41:40.057 --> 01:41:43.598
Want to have a drink with me?

01:41:45.849 --> 01:41:47.390
Seems like you already had some.

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.640
All right.

01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:57.889
After slaving for 25 years,

01:41:57.890 --> 01:42:00.265
they gave me 25 minutes to clear out.

01:42:01.057 --> 01:42:02.515
I walk out of the office,

01:42:02.765 --> 01:42:06.681
and the security guard
had my things in a box already

01:42:06.682 --> 01:42:08.974
and was standing there, holding it.

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.890
They wouldn't let me go down
the hallway where I'd always walked.

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.848
Sent you out the back door?

01:42:15.849 --> 01:42:16.931
Exactly.

01:42:16.932 --> 01:42:18.640
Fucking dickwads!

01:42:19.432 --> 01:42:20.890
Hurry up and eat.

01:42:43.515 --> 01:42:44.598
Not again!

01:42:44.932 --> 01:42:47.265
If you don't eat,
I'll take that paper away!

01:42:48.807 --> 01:42:53.015
You need to eat, so your arms get strong,
and your bowing gets stronger.

01:42:57.765 --> 01:43:02.015
Why are the men in this house
all hiding something from me, Ri-one?

01:43:02.515 --> 01:43:03.932
Why could it be?

01:43:04.432 --> 01:43:06.515
Do they want to die?

01:43:07.515 --> 01:43:11.723
My quality ratio was 96%.

01:43:12.432 --> 01:43:14.932
On those old Bumin machines.

01:43:16.557 --> 01:43:20.765
They don't give out Pulp Man of the Year
to any old fool.

01:43:21.432 --> 01:43:22.890
Hey, eat up. Eat this.

01:43:24.557 --> 01:43:25.515
Right.

01:43:26.807 --> 01:43:29.682
If they gave it to any old fool,
I'd have gotten one.

01:43:31.515 --> 01:43:34.724
Hey, that's not what I meant!

01:43:36.598 --> 01:43:38.181
Sorry, fuck.

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.390
Damn it, drink up.

01:43:42.223 --> 01:43:43.056
“Fuck”?

01:43:44.181 --> 01:43:45.515
No, I...

01:43:52.348 --> 01:43:54.681
Hey! Listen to you.

01:43:54.682 --> 01:43:56.640
I fucking love it, fuck!

01:43:57.014 --> 01:43:59.223
- Have a fucking drink!
- Let's fucking drink!

01:44:07.807 --> 01:44:10.265
Hey, slow down a bit.

01:44:12.014 --> 01:44:14.223
To hell with that, I'm drinking fast.

01:44:16.056 --> 01:44:17.723
Do they want to die?

01:44:21.098 --> 01:44:23.724
So you saw it,
or you think you saw it?

01:44:29.724 --> 01:44:32.765
I'll die if I keep working like this.

01:44:33.849 --> 01:44:38.557
With this much work to do,
I need another manager.

01:44:43.890 --> 01:44:45.140
Right.

01:44:47.515 --> 01:44:48.557
At your level!

01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:50.598
That's what I'm saying!

01:44:54.014 --> 01:44:56.140
Man-su my man, you crying?

01:44:59.473 --> 01:45:00.765
Feel sorry for me?

01:45:05.849 --> 01:45:07.640
Why so soft-hearted?

01:45:10.348 --> 01:45:11.890
Ask the higher-ups.

01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:13.306
Ask what?

01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:18.056
Ask them to hire someone else!

01:45:19.348 --> 01:45:20.931
Those tight-assed pricks?

01:45:21.973 --> 01:45:24.389
If you sit tight,
their asses get tighter!

01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:25.849
Demand it!

01:45:26.056 --> 01:45:27.724
Just collapse at work one day!

01:45:28.265 --> 01:45:30.640
You'll need sick leave!
Production will stop!

01:45:31.348 --> 01:45:33.515
Won't they come to their senses then?

01:45:36.432 --> 01:45:39.849
Come to their senses?
They'll just fire me.

01:45:40.056 --> 01:45:41.348
Recommend me.

01:45:42.223 --> 01:45:44.223
We'd work really well together!

01:45:44.432 --> 01:45:45.682
Complementing each other.

01:45:46.807 --> 01:45:47.973
A Team, B Team.

01:45:50.557 --> 01:45:51.889
Sure.

01:45:53.098 --> 01:45:54.724
I'll try talking to them.

01:46:08.223 --> 01:46:09.515
Oh dear.

01:46:10.724 --> 01:46:12.640
So this is the best you got?

01:46:14.557 --> 01:46:17.557
I know, water streaks.

01:46:18.807 --> 01:46:23.472
It's the cross-link cellulose recipe
of those bastards at Bumin.

01:46:23.473 --> 01:46:24.640
But you know,

01:46:26.973 --> 01:46:29.306
I've got no other choice.

01:46:29.598 --> 01:46:31.765
Even if you use their machines,

01:46:32.223 --> 01:46:34.390
you don't have to use their recipe, too.

01:46:34.598 --> 01:46:38.265
How can you afford this house
as a line manager? And that car?

01:46:38.557 --> 01:46:42.640
Someone might think you're
pocketing all kinds of cash.

01:46:44.056 --> 01:46:45.848
That's not what I think,

01:46:46.265 --> 01:46:49.432
but others might think that way, I mean.

01:46:51.432 --> 01:46:53.432
I really don't think that. Here.

01:46:55.557 --> 01:46:56.682
Bottoms up.

01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:07.432
You okay?

01:47:21.931 --> 01:47:23.682
You're dead now.

01:47:36.724 --> 01:47:38.140
Bomb shots, okay?

01:48:15.432 --> 01:48:17.557
No other choice.

01:48:18.682 --> 01:48:20.640
No other choice...

01:48:22.265 --> 01:48:24.515
Hurry the fuck up!

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.640
So freaking cold...

01:49:25.557 --> 01:49:26.889
My head...

01:49:34.848 --> 01:49:36.390
Where do you keep the...?

01:50:18.639 --> 01:50:21.223
What a fucking relief!

01:50:26.681 --> 01:50:29.432
I need some fucking air!

01:50:29.639 --> 01:50:30.432
Let's go out.

01:50:30.848 --> 01:50:35.306
Getting drunk in front of a bonfire
is my lifelong dream!

01:50:35.973 --> 01:50:37.888
You're freaking awesome.

01:50:37.889 --> 01:50:39.056
Vodka.

01:50:42.181 --> 01:50:44.348
You had more?

01:50:45.515 --> 01:50:46.848
Man-superman

01:50:47.473 --> 01:50:49.223
you're the best!

01:51:05.432 --> 01:51:10.181
I moved here 6 months ago
and it's my first fucking bonfire.

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:17.597
I thought I'd have barbecue every day.

01:51:18.597 --> 01:51:22.014
When you get the thing you want,
that's what happens.

01:51:23.473 --> 01:51:25.722
My wife was right.

01:51:29.889 --> 01:51:32.931
I really don't want to do this.

01:51:33.223 --> 01:51:34.014
What?

01:51:35.473 --> 01:51:39.515
But if I don't, the deaths of
those other two are meaningless.

01:51:41.098 --> 01:51:42.306
Just a dog's death.

01:51:43.806 --> 01:51:45.515
No...

01:51:46.515 --> 01:51:49.473
You shouldn't barbecue dogs!

01:53:57.931 --> 01:54:00.223
Ms. Wife

01:54:11.056 --> 01:54:13.764
Sorry, I can't turn on the video.

01:54:14.223 --> 01:54:16.389
It's okay. You look at me.

01:54:16.764 --> 01:54:19.098
I didn't want to get your hopes up,

01:54:19.389 --> 01:54:21.514
but I'm visiting a friend from Moon Paper.

01:54:24.931 --> 01:54:29.265
He's got so much work,
the company needs another line manager.

01:54:29.639 --> 01:54:31.514
Remember what the detectives said?

01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:33.806
- About the interviewees.
- Yeah.

01:54:35.014 --> 01:54:35.973
That they died.

01:54:36.806 --> 01:54:37.722
Yeah?

01:54:41.014 --> 01:54:42.014
So?

01:54:43.931 --> 01:54:45.140
I'm worried.

01:54:45.931 --> 01:54:49.764
- You go around late at night...
- Hey, I'm okay.

01:54:51.098 --> 01:54:52.722
How can you be so sure?

01:54:53.098 --> 01:54:54.265
Because I'm...

01:54:55.806 --> 01:54:57.098
me?

01:54:58.514 --> 01:55:01.431
Hey, can't you drop that
and come home now?

01:55:02.347 --> 01:55:04.681
I don't want to say this, but no.

01:55:05.098 --> 01:55:07.181
Don't carry the load by yourself.

01:55:07.389 --> 01:55:09.596
Even a sheet of paper
is better lifted together.

01:55:09.597 --> 01:55:13.431
That's a favorite saying in our industry.
A sheet of paper.

01:55:14.265 --> 01:55:17.555
If the four of us band together,
we can beat this.

01:55:17.556 --> 01:55:18.388
Six.

01:55:18.389 --> 01:55:21.055
I know, Si-two Ri-two.

01:55:21.056 --> 01:55:23.013
I'm going to bring them back.

01:55:23.014 --> 01:55:25.889
You'd be good at gardening
or bonsai, too.

01:55:26.556 --> 01:55:29.556
People live to 100, you have time.

01:55:29.889 --> 01:55:31.514
This is my last interview.

01:55:31.848 --> 01:55:35.305
Up until now I've been digging,
now I need to plant the tree.

01:55:35.514 --> 01:55:38.389
If you do something bad,

01:55:38.889 --> 01:55:41.556
I'm doing it with you, okay?

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:49.265
Hey, don't worry.

01:55:50.764 --> 01:55:52.389
I think my friend woke up.

01:55:53.098 --> 01:55:55.805
- Your cheek...
- I'll call tomorrow, okay? Bye.

01:55:55.806 --> 01:55:56.723
Honey!

01:57:03.764 --> 01:57:05.389
Si-one, Si-one!

01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:07.639
It's okay.

01:57:11.472 --> 01:57:13.140
I dug in the ground.

01:57:14.389 --> 01:57:15.431
There?

01:57:15.973 --> 01:57:17.764
There really was something.

01:57:20.723 --> 01:57:22.098
He cut up a pig?

01:57:22.431 --> 01:57:23.514
Yes.

01:57:30.848 --> 01:57:33.556
Like when he barbecued
a pig for us last year?

01:57:34.556 --> 01:57:37.680
He put a whole pig in the ground
to fertilize the tree.

01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:39.597
Must've been so tough for him.

01:57:40.222 --> 01:57:42.556
So that's what it was,

01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.305
a pig...

01:59:07.139 --> 01:59:08.848
Did the interview go well?

01:59:11.347 --> 01:59:12.264
Yeah.

01:59:14.597 --> 01:59:15.681
Did you sleep well?

01:59:34.431 --> 01:59:35.848
Just one minute.

01:59:38.973 --> 01:59:43.638
59, 58, 57...

01:59:43.639 --> 01:59:45.722
Count up, not down.

01:59:47.472 --> 01:59:53.514
1, 2, 3, 4...

01:59:56.305 --> 01:59:58.597
So you drank, in the end.

01:59:59.222 --> 02:00:00.305
Yeah.

02:00:01.931 --> 02:00:03.431
You smell of smoke, too.

02:00:03.889 --> 02:00:06.180
We had a barbecue at my friend's place.

02:00:07.055 --> 02:00:09.973
He's been on his own six months,
but he's lonely already.

02:00:11.222 --> 02:00:12.139
Divorced?

02:00:12.889 --> 02:00:15.055
They split up because of the house.

02:00:16.055 --> 02:00:20.055
He wanted to live in nature,
but she refused.

02:00:20.305 --> 02:00:22.347
Can that be a reason?

02:00:24.264 --> 02:00:25.973
Splitting up over that?

02:00:29.973 --> 02:00:30.973
I'm sorry.

02:00:31.681 --> 02:00:36.431
When I was doing my degree,
I couldn't have fun with you.

02:00:39.055 --> 02:00:43.305
You shouldn't have lived so hard.

02:00:56.556 --> 02:00:58.889
How many seconds? 30?

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:05.431
59.

02:01:06.681 --> 02:01:07.389
60.

02:01:18.972 --> 02:01:21.305
That must've been hard for you.

02:01:22.222 --> 02:01:27.722
So what I realized
while going through that ordeal

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.012
is you need a creative plan.

02:01:30.013 --> 02:01:32.931
The important thing
is to shift your perspective.

02:01:33.347 --> 02:01:36.388
In the execution phase,
you have to be persistent and bold.

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:40.639
When necessary, at any time
you need to be able to say no.

02:01:51.930 --> 02:01:53.971
We have a “lights-out system”.

02:01:53.972 --> 02:01:57.430
Recently we built
a fully automated factory.

02:01:57.431 --> 02:01:58.638
Lights out?

02:01:58.639 --> 02:02:02.138
- Since AI doesn't need lights turned on.
- Right.

02:02:02.139 --> 02:02:06.929
The days of tapping a roll
with a stick are over.

02:02:06.930 --> 02:02:08.264
Yes, of course.

02:02:08.514 --> 02:02:11.264
Anyway, we quite urgently need you

02:02:11.764 --> 02:02:13.347
to oversee this test run.

02:02:14.764 --> 02:02:18.472
When you say fully automated,
the workers...

02:02:19.097 --> 02:02:21.347
...will have to be reduced, right?

02:02:21.888 --> 02:02:25.222
That's the whole point of the system.
No other choice.

02:02:25.930 --> 02:02:28.139
Do you have any objection?

02:02:35.139 --> 02:02:37.806
If you don't like it, you can say no.

02:02:38.764 --> 02:02:39.887
Not at all.

02:02:39.888 --> 02:02:42.264
How can you go against the times?

02:02:43.013 --> 02:02:49.389
But at any rate, you need one person
to watch over it all, right?

02:02:53.888 --> 02:02:58.264
So 5 years ago, there was a secret bid
at Minting and Security Printing Corp?

02:02:58.556 --> 02:03:04.681
Yes, the competition was fierce then.

02:03:06.013 --> 02:03:10.431
Solar, where I worked, was one of
the three designated companies.

02:03:11.055 --> 02:03:14.139
We never even considered bidding.

02:03:15.264 --> 02:03:16.930
Then who made the bid?

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:21.431
Two people facing off as representatives
of the two major paper companies.

02:03:21.806 --> 02:03:26.639
Who were the rivals
in this bloody bidding war?

02:03:29.597 --> 02:03:30.930
Gu Bummo and

02:03:31.472 --> 02:03:32.347
Go Sijo!

02:03:33.222 --> 02:03:36.139
The day he returned
from his business trip to Daejeon...

02:03:36.930 --> 02:03:39.847
His sleep-talking woke me up
in the middle of the night.

02:03:41.639 --> 02:03:45.180
He started crying and whining,

02:03:47.347 --> 02:03:51.556
saying things like “It's not fair!”
and “Don't insult me!”

02:03:53.639 --> 02:03:54.805
Then after that,

02:03:56.013 --> 02:03:57.389
wouldn't you know...

02:04:01.639 --> 02:04:03.389
He was surely asleep,

02:04:04.139 --> 02:04:06.888
but he gathered the phlegm
in his mouth and...

02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:15.514
He spit on his own face.

02:04:18.805 --> 02:04:20.597
It startled him too, and he woke up.

02:04:22.264 --> 02:04:24.054
The day he came back from Daejeon?

02:04:24.055 --> 02:04:25.431
“It's so unfair”?

02:04:27.055 --> 02:04:30.347
As you know, Minting and Security
Printing Corp is in Daejeon.

02:04:33.389 --> 02:04:35.264
Was that when it started?

02:04:36.888 --> 02:04:40.805
He just listened to music here,
avoided going to bed with me.

02:04:41.514 --> 02:04:46.723
After he got fired,
he drank all day, developed depression...

02:04:47.514 --> 02:04:48.389
Oh my god.

02:04:49.805 --> 02:04:51.723
He didn't bring his medication.

02:04:54.472 --> 02:04:55.431
Honey,

02:04:56.389 --> 02:04:58.012
where in the world are you?

02:04:58.013 --> 02:05:01.180
Does your husband own
a handgun by any chance?

02:05:08.639 --> 02:05:11.305
Can I ask why you take
so long to answer?

02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:17.763
If you own a firearm,
you need to report it, right?

02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:20.139
He didn't do that.

02:05:20.389 --> 02:05:21.472
What's more,

02:05:23.139 --> 02:05:25.055
it vanished with my husband.

02:05:25.847 --> 02:05:27.472
He could...

02:05:28.389 --> 02:05:29.847
commit suicide with it.

02:05:30.805 --> 02:05:32.055
Please find him quickly.

02:05:36.972 --> 02:05:38.514
Was it one of these?

02:05:56.556 --> 02:05:57.639
This one?

02:06:06.972 --> 02:06:10.139
Gu Bummo's wife really said that?

02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:14.972
So be wary of Gu Bummo.

02:06:15.514 --> 02:06:16.888
Remember his face.

02:06:21.097 --> 02:06:25.556
Gu Bummo killed Go Sijo and ran away?

02:06:27.389 --> 02:06:29.972
Wow, this is...

02:06:42.847 --> 02:06:44.097
Honey!

02:06:47.013 --> 02:06:48.514
Got something to say?

02:06:53.597 --> 02:06:55.680
Congrats on your first day at work.

02:07:00.222 --> 02:07:02.304
This weekend, should we do a pig roast?

02:07:02.305 --> 02:07:03.264
- No.
- No way!

02:07:08.805 --> 02:07:12.514
It's too cold for that now.

02:07:14.264 --> 02:07:19.012
Quit the clinic and take up tennis again.
I'll buy you a new racket.

02:07:19.013 --> 02:07:20.930
I'm not doing that anymore.

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:22.972
I'll save money.

02:07:27.638 --> 02:07:29.389
Si-two Ri-two, house!

02:07:29.721 --> 02:07:30.638
House!

02:07:33.139 --> 02:07:35.431
Ri-one, come here! Don't play over there.

02:07:36.431 --> 02:07:38.595
A snail! A snail!

02:07:38.596 --> 02:07:40.514
I called the real estate agent.

02:07:41.722 --> 02:07:43.264
Said we'll keep the house.

02:07:43.805 --> 02:07:45.012
Oh.

02:07:45.013 --> 02:07:48.472
We planted an apple tree here,
how can we sell it?

02:07:49.013 --> 02:07:50.305
Exactly.

02:07:51.555 --> 02:07:52.972
Ri-one!

02:07:54.389 --> 02:07:55.389
Ri-one!

02:07:56.555 --> 02:07:58.097
I'll see you later.

02:08:02.264 --> 02:08:05.472
Bugs are eating it alive.

02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:15.679
...will ease up sometime this morning.

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:19.263
After the nighttime rain which
seemed to mourn the passing of autumn,

02:08:19.264 --> 02:08:23.638
the temperature also dropped sharply,
bringing us one step closer to winter.

02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.471
- Going to school already?
- Dongho and I are meeting early.

02:08:40.472 --> 02:08:42.847
Are you two still friends?

02:08:43.097 --> 02:08:45.805
