00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.079
Why are you still having people spy on him?

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:47.719
Can you just calm down for a moment?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.439
What are you talking about?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.119
Is this spying?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.399
Spying is illegal, you know.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.640
What I'm doing is called...

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.840
supervision.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.679
Do you understand?

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.119
Supervising our son.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.039
Xin Tong is such a good girl.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.520
We mustn't let her down.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.680
You always have a point.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.640
Of course.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560
I still need to do something more.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.159
Senior Mr. Wen came early in the morning.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.519
Is there something major going on?

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:20.879
No idea.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.439
President Wen!

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.359
President Wen!

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.719
What's going on?

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:24.359
Yeah.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.400
Why so early?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.799
So handsome!

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:28.519
Dad.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.599
What brings you here?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.959
Didn't expect me, did you?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.760
I came today...

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.480
to arrange something for you to do.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.359
Your relationship...

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.959
doesn't seem to be known in the company, right?

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:49.920
Right.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.719
That's where you're wrong.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:56.959
As a man,

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.239
you should announce to the whole world...

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:00.359
that she...

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.000
is your beloved.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.800
Roses!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.680
So romantic!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.520
Can we have lunch together at noon?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.879
This world is too crazy.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.599
Sure.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.479
Xin Tong.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.879
What would you like for lunch?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.680
I'm fine with anything, Uncle.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.000
How can we be so casual?

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:27.159
Tell me.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.120
What do you think about...

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.800
Cantonese food,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.400
or...

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.960
Sichuan cuisine?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.000
Chinese or Western?

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.240
Japanese, Korean BBQ...

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.879
Anything is fine.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.479
Pick whatever you like.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.960
Don't be shy at all.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.240
Then...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.800
char siu bao...

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.639
and pineapple buns.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.240
The ones here aren't authentic.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.039
No problem.

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.719
Then I'll change it.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:43.400
No, no, no!

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.960
No need to change.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.639
I know a great place.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.919
It's me.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.840
Get ready.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.159
I'll be there in ten minutes.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.280
Pei An.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.159
To the base.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.120
Let's go.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.520
Let's go eat...

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.560
the most authentic...

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.159
pineapple buns.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.800
Let's go.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.280
This is too much.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:28.399
Pei An.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.120
Help her fasten her seatbelt.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.120
Don't be nervous.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.680
We're taking off soon.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.680
Xin Tong.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.319
If you want pineapple buns,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.240
you must come to Macau, China to eat them...

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.959
for them to be...

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.000
the most authentic.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.000
In Macau, China, big and small,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.839
dozens...

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:20.879
hundreds...

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:21.879
of places make pineapple buns.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.560
Only this one...

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.279
Don't judge by its small storefront.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:26.639
The taste is the best.

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:27.240
Quickly,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.639
try it.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:29.160
Uncle.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.879
We just came for a casual lunch.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.480
Isn't this too extravagant?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.439
Extravagant?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.800
What extravagance?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.800
We're still in the country,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.879
not going abroad.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.959
Xin Tong.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:42.319
In the future, just tell me what you want to eat.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.680
No matter where it is,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.399
we'll go.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.920
The plane is our own.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.360
We don't care about a bit of fuel cost.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.680
Come on, come on.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.040
Try it, try it quickly.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.279
Thank you, Uncle.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:00.680
Xin Tong!

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.199
Quick, confess the truth to me!

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.120
Confess what?

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:06.279
Of course...

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.480
your love story with the president!

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.720
Me? I...

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.199
I never noticed before.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.160
You're quite good at having a secret affair.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.279
What nonsense is this?

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.600
What's between us is...

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:23.959
online romance.

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.279
Online romance?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.600
Why can't I net someone so reliable online?

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:31.680
What app did you use?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.240
"People Nearby."

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.480
So old-fashioned.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.639
You know what?

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.519
Rico is the illegitimate daughter of the Xin Family of Hong Kong, China.

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.399
So it's a family alliance marriage.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.680
Alliance marriage?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.160
Hidden so deeply.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.040
Couldn't tell at all.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.800
If I had known earlier,

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:54.920
I would have made a move on the president sooner.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.439
It still wouldn't be your turn.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.319
It wouldn't be either of your turns.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.160
I heard...

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:06.000
Rico...

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.319
got pregnant before marriage.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:09.000
There's gossip!

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.560
She has an amazing alcohol tolerance.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.040
She directly got the president drunk.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.519
And took him by force.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.680
I think it's a great story to ship!

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.120
Our own boss and colleague...

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.360
Just thinking about it...

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.120
I can't ship it at all.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.000
How come I didn't know?

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.600
I'm that impressive myself?

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.000
Not buying it?

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.839
I feel like...

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.560
It's quite believable.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.639
You guys don't know yet, do you?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.360
It's about Rico and the president.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.079
What is it?

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:53.759
I think...

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.160
This gold digger has been trained.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:57.600
There really are such training courses?

00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.920
Where do I sign up?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.120
Go to HR to sign up.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.839
Since Rico joined the marketing department...

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.480
the value she has created...

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.480
exceeds that of all your departments combined.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.519
Especially this livestream...

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.680
has broken the company's sales record.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.279
It's hard for me not to have feelings...

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.199
for such an outstanding woman.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.079
So you've misunderstood.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.839
Actually, I made the first move.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.080
Just now...

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.120
Thank you for your impassioned speech.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.200
Just stating facts.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.519
Don't take what they said to heart.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:00.960
I...

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:06.720
Hello, Uncle.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.919
Good, good, good.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.399
Let me introduce to you...

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.639
these four.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080
They are chefs I specially hired...

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.000
for Sichuan cuisine...

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.799
Cantonese cuisine...

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.639
Huaiyang cuisine...

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:17.639
and Shandong cuisine.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:18.879
Four master chefs.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.000
Starting today...

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.159
they will be...

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:24.080
responsible for Xin Tong's...

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.960
three daily meals.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:26.120
So, what do you think?

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:27.519
Surprised?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.879
Unexpected?

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:30.720
Very surprised.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:31.840
Very unexpected.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.120
Thank you, Uncle.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.360
No need, no need, no need.

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:37.279
There's an even bigger surprise.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:38.639
There's more?

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.200
No way.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.279
This is too much.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:53.639
Xin Tong...

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.320
Your uncle...

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.759
did his homework in advance.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.080
I opened your Little Blue Book...

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.039
and I found...

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.320
you like a lot of brands.

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:04.320
So...

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:06.960
I contacted the heads of these brands.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:07.960
From now on...

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.120
every quarter...

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.279
every new product they launch...

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:12.559
will be sent here...

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:13.960
for you to choose from.

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.120
Thank you, Uncle.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.039
But...

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.240
they're not all things I actually like.

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:21.480
Those were just personas...

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.679
I crafted online.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:24.879
You don't like them?

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:27.600
It's fine, it's fine.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:29.039
Tell your uncle...

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.480
what brands you *do* like.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.080
I like...

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.840
Uncle...

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.759
I actually love all of these.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:36.600
Thank you, Uncle.

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:37.679
As long as you like them.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.279
That's all that matters.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.159
By the way...

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.000
there's one more...

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:42.639
very important thing.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:58.320
Pei An.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.120
What I promised you...

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:01.720
now...

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.039
I will fulfill that promise.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.639
Four Seas Group...

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.120
is yours.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.600
Remember my words.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.840
Work hard.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.159
Love well.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.720
I have high hopes for you two.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.159
Congratulations.
