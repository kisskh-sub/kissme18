=The Company=
=Season 1=

00:01:38.045 --> 00:01:41.140
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.140
=Episode 29=

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.399
Market Lord.

00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:54.017
Has Bizhi left?

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:56.817
His injuries haven't healed yet.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.170
Why are you in such a hurry
to drive him away?

00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:00.776
I said before that when I returned,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.210
I didn't want to see anyone unrelated
to Tianguang Market

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:04.657
appearing at Luoxia Manor.

00:02:04.844 --> 00:02:07.400
Sheltering him will only
bring trouble to Tianguang Market.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.990
As the Lord of Tianguang Market,
you must not act so willfully.

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:10.977
Make him leave at once.

00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:17.817
Do you think I wanted to be Market Lord?

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:20.657
Tianguang Market is no trivial place.

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:23.489
Since you are the Market Lord,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.577
you must bear
the corresponding responsibility.

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:27.057
Market Lord...

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:28.416
How ridiculous.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.377
Just because you gild
the word "prisoner",

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:33.696
does it stop being a prisoner?

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:42.377
Stop talking about Tianguang Market
all the time.

00:02:42.576 --> 00:02:44.616
The outside world
is already badly battered.

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:46.657
Why doesn't Time Administration
deal with that?

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:54.296
Different departments
have different duties.

00:02:55.817 --> 00:02:58.296
Can you guarantee
that the Time Administration

00:02:58.296 --> 00:02:59.497
won't harm Bizhi?

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.466
The Time Administration
has its own procedures.

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:02.576
I don't believe that.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.217
If Bizhi is handed over to you,
he'll be doomed.

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:08.337
Aren't all of you there just like you,

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:09.977
emotionless wooden figures?

00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:14.257
Back then,

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:17.176
you volunteered to be my supervisor.

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:20.257
You've spent a long time here.

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:23.016
There are barely any people
you can even talk to.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.097
The biggest matter each day
is being bullied by me.

00:03:27.977 --> 00:03:29.856
Is a life like this really worth it?

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:35.537
This is my duty.

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:44.176
I often wonder

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.817
whether coming to Tianguang Market

00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:48.377
was the right choice.

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:52.016
People who come here

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:54.176
come and go.

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:57.000
Once they leave, they forget everything,

00:03:58.777 --> 00:03:59.817
taking nothing with them.

00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:04.696
I don't exist in anyone's memory either.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.416
You're the same.

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:13.736
That's the law of nature.

00:04:14.377 --> 00:04:15.257
It can't be changed.

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:20.256
People of your era

00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:22.616
always talk about natural laws,

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:26.209
as if mastering them

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.422
really makes you gods.

00:04:31.697 --> 00:04:33.217
But are you truly happy?

00:04:35.457 --> 00:04:36.816
I only want the mission completed.

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.657
What do you mean by "completed"?

00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:41.416
Finish my term here at Tianguang Market.

00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:45.137
And then?

00:04:54.056 --> 00:04:55.056
When the mission ends,

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:56.616
I will leave as well.

00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:59.056
The Time Administration will erase

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.777
all my memories from this mission.

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:07.816
I know.

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:11.337
You've said it many times already.

00:05:25.056 --> 00:05:26.296
Bizhi left long ago.

00:05:26.856 --> 00:05:27.816
Satisfied now?

00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:15.256
It's all fake!

00:06:15.697 --> 00:06:17.017
None of it is real.

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:46.176
Who are you?

00:06:50.296 --> 00:06:51.856
(Luoxia Manor)
Hurry, go!

00:06:52.217 --> 00:06:53.017
Move!

00:06:53.537 --> 00:06:54.337
Hurry up!

00:06:55.296 --> 00:06:55.777
Go!

00:07:10.977 --> 00:07:11.697
Market Lord.

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:12.657
Be careful.

00:07:12.977 --> 00:07:13.936
They have weapons!

00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:18.416
What's that?

00:07:19.056 --> 00:07:20.736
Just for emergencies.

00:07:21.056 --> 00:07:22.137
Don't worry, Market Lord.

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:24.657
We're not bad people.

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:27.097
We just want to ask about someone.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:28.936
Who are you looking for?

00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:30.777
Bizhi.

00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:33.137
You should know him.

00:07:37.496 --> 00:07:38.296
Bizhi?

00:07:39.337 --> 00:07:39.977
Who's that?

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:46.256
This man tried to scam me
with a fake painting,

00:07:46.977 --> 00:07:49.736
and used an unregistered time elevator.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.176
He caused us a lot of trouble.

00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:55.256
But what we're certain of now is,

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:57.416
he must be in Tianguang Market.

00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:00.466
You wouldn't say you don't know,
would you?

00:08:00.736 --> 00:08:03.376
So many people come and go here
every day.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.690
Even if I'm the Market Lord,

00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:06.537
I can't remember everyone's name.

00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:08.217
Besides,

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:10.250
I stopped wanting this position
long ago.

00:08:10.496 --> 00:08:11.376
Let us go.

00:08:24.017 --> 00:08:24.616
Market Lord.

00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:25.777
No.

00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:27.936
I should call you

00:08:28.337 --> 00:08:29.537
Miao Tong.

00:08:30.816 --> 00:08:32.937
For such a lovely little sister
like you,

00:08:33.622 --> 00:08:35.622
I really can't bring myself to hate you.

00:08:38.297 --> 00:08:39.896
But acting

00:08:42.736 --> 00:08:44.337
still depends on talent.

00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:50.016
I simply feel sorry for you.

00:08:50.856 --> 00:08:53.376
You're clearly a pitiful child
who was deceived,

00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:56.376
yet you still insist on protecting

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.616
the people of the Time Administration.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:04.697
What do you mean?

00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:10.177
I know about your past,

00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:12.177
Miao Tong.

00:09:13.337 --> 00:09:14.656
What do you know?

00:09:17.016 --> 00:09:18.457
I know a great deal.

00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:21.856
Back then, the villagers of Miao Village

00:09:22.817 --> 00:09:24.337
were never saved.

00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:35.856
Market Lord.

00:09:36.697 --> 00:09:37.889
They are time-space criminal.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.222
Don't listen to their nonsense!

00:09:41.376 --> 00:09:42.776
Why should I believe you?

00:09:45.656 --> 00:09:46.457
Perfect.

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.217
We also have a time elevator.

00:09:51.496 --> 00:09:53.016
I can take you to see it yourself.

00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:02.736
Market Lord.

00:10:03.256 --> 00:10:04.337
Market Lord!

00:10:13.517 --> 00:10:17.237
(Miao Village)

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:33.856
I once believed

00:11:35.177 --> 00:11:36.536
that sacrificing myself

00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:39.896
could truly protect everyone.

00:11:43.016 --> 00:11:45.177
So it was all a lie...

00:11:57.496 --> 00:11:58.977
You promised me.

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:02.457
Why didn't you save

00:12:02.457 --> 00:12:04.136
67 people of Miao Village?

00:12:09.536 --> 00:12:10.977
Because, according to protocol,

00:12:11.977 --> 00:12:13.697
the order of time cannot be disrupted.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.656
Then why did you save me?

00:12:23.496 --> 00:12:25.256
Because I didn't want you to die there.

00:12:25.697 --> 00:12:26.337
No.

00:12:28.297 --> 00:12:29.776
It's because you saw

00:12:29.776 --> 00:12:32.337
that I was useful
to the Time Administration.

00:12:32.337 --> 00:12:34.376
That's why I was allowed to live.

00:12:35.457 --> 00:12:39.256
You always say great technology
can't surpass human talent.

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:41.776
So someone like me

00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:43.977
is extremely rare even in the future.

00:12:45.177 --> 00:12:47.736
I don't know how long I stayed
in Tianguang Market.

00:12:47.736 --> 00:12:49.977
I didn't know what
was happening outside.

00:12:50.817 --> 00:12:53.217
Every day I repeated the same things.

00:12:53.577 --> 00:12:54.776
People came and went.

00:12:54.776 --> 00:12:56.417
Only you stayed with me.

00:12:56.457 --> 00:12:58.616
But you were lying to me all along!

00:12:58.817 --> 00:12:59.457
No.

00:13:00.217 --> 00:13:01.697
That's not true.

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:08.256
Chu Qiu.

00:13:10.577 --> 00:13:12.417
If I had known it would be like this,

00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:15.776
I would never have begged you.

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:20.016
I'd rather have died in that real home

00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:21.736
than guard this fake room

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:23.817
and someone who kept lying to me.

00:13:26.496 --> 00:13:27.536
I'm sorry.

00:13:30.337 --> 00:13:31.616
I'm truly sorry.

00:13:32.856 --> 00:13:34.656
I never want to see you again.

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.057
Never.

00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:44.616
Market Lord.

00:13:44.817 --> 00:13:45.656
Market Lord.

00:13:46.817 --> 00:13:48.097
Miao Tong!

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:54.097
Is there really no way
to save her family?

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.496
She's truly pitiful.

00:13:55.616 --> 00:13:56.856
Commissioner Chu Qiu.

00:13:57.457 --> 00:14:00.057
The tragedy of Miao Village
is a fixed historical node.

00:14:00.616 --> 00:14:02.937
You may take Miao Tong back
to the Time Administration

00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:04.937
and train her as a time-space analyst.

00:14:05.457 --> 00:14:08.177
At least that way,
her life can be preserved.

00:14:20.376 --> 00:14:21.536
Are you okay?

00:14:29.097 --> 00:14:30.496
Being betrayed

00:14:30.697 --> 00:14:32.496
by the one you trust most.

00:14:33.856 --> 00:14:35.417
I understand that feeling.

00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:38.136
I once

00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:40.656
trusted someone without hesitation.

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:43.057
And what was the result?

00:14:47.977 --> 00:14:48.776
Look.

00:14:52.856 --> 00:14:53.817
I know

00:14:54.337 --> 00:14:56.217
that with the technology of our era,

00:14:56.337 --> 00:14:57.856
we could create

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.896
a real leg identical to the original.

00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:03.337
But I choose to keep
this ugly prosthetic leg

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:05.217
to remind myself at all times.

00:15:05.217 --> 00:15:07.736
Never forget the one
who betrayed you.

00:15:13.136 --> 00:15:14.457
What do you plan to do next?

00:15:18.457 --> 00:15:19.856
I want to leave Tianguang Market.

00:15:21.577 --> 00:15:22.217
Alright.

00:15:22.736 --> 00:15:23.697
I can help you.

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.217
There is only one commissioner

00:15:26.466 --> 00:15:28.170
from the Time Administration here.

00:15:31.977 --> 00:15:33.457
It will be up to you

00:15:34.057 --> 00:15:35.136
how to deal with him.

00:15:44.417 --> 00:15:46.337
I know you still don't trust me.

00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:48.297
But please think about it.

00:15:49.536 --> 00:15:51.016
If you leave,

00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:53.817
will the people
of the Time Administration let you go?

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:55.337
And I

00:15:55.736 --> 00:15:57.057
have a time elevator.

00:15:57.496 --> 00:15:59.057
Not only can it help you escape,

00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:01.057
but it can also send you back to

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:03.496
before the tragedy of Miao Village.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.536
This is a dangerous move.

00:16:10.755 --> 00:16:12.890
But I'm willing to make an exception
for you.

00:16:13.776 --> 00:16:14.656
I understand.

00:16:15.457 --> 00:16:17.057
You want to see your parents again,

00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:19.217
watch them

00:16:19.217 --> 00:16:20.457
live out their days in peace,

00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:21.977
and pass away naturally.

00:16:22.776 --> 00:16:23.496
Right?

00:16:29.097 --> 00:16:31.097
I can help you make up for your mistake.

00:16:31.817 --> 00:16:33.136
And all you need to do

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:35.016
is tell me where Bizhi went.

00:16:35.736 --> 00:16:36.937
Where is he?

00:16:43.457 --> 00:16:45.097
He isn't my enemy either.

00:16:45.856 --> 00:16:46.736
It's just

00:16:46.736 --> 00:16:48.577
that he knows too many of our secrets.

00:16:48.896 --> 00:16:50.057
For us,

00:16:50.136 --> 00:16:51.097
he's dangerous.

00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:52.776
I promise you.

00:16:53.057 --> 00:16:54.337
If we find him,

00:16:54.337 --> 00:16:55.896
I'll do my best to persuade him

00:16:55.896 --> 00:16:57.057
to join us.

00:16:57.536 --> 00:16:58.656
Then you and he

00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:00.016
can remain friends.

00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:02.256
As if nothing ever changed.

00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:02.776
Alright?

00:17:05.937 --> 00:17:07.576
You must promise not to hurt him.

00:17:09.897 --> 00:17:11.336
I don't want to hurt him either.

00:17:11.937 --> 00:17:12.776
So

00:17:13.217 --> 00:17:15.536
you need to work with me
to persuade him.

00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:17.816
The problem now

00:17:18.377 --> 00:17:19.336
is only one thing.

00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:22.697
That man called Chu Qiu

00:17:23.217 --> 00:17:25.177
knows too much about Fusheng Hall.

00:17:25.417 --> 00:17:27.056
We can't keep him alive.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.644
How do you want to deal with him?

00:17:35.016 --> 00:17:37.657
There's a kind of punishment
called time-space exile.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.617
It means throwing someone
into a certain era.

00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:42.897
Without a time elevator,
he can never return.

00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:46.296
If he's lucky, he'll start a new life.

00:17:47.096 --> 00:17:48.336
If he's unlucky,

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.457
he'll learn wilderness survival

00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:53.177
or be locked up as a madman.

00:17:55.256 --> 00:17:56.897
I want him sent to Miao Village.

00:18:01.937 --> 00:18:03.336
I really underestimated you.

00:18:04.177 --> 00:18:05.016
But

00:18:05.697 --> 00:18:06.736
I have one condition.

00:18:07.496 --> 00:18:09.177
I want his memories erased.

00:18:09.937 --> 00:18:12.617
So even if the Time Administration
finds him later,

00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:14.296
for us,

00:18:14.617 --> 00:18:15.857
it will be absolutely safe.

00:18:24.177 --> 00:18:26.096
Bizhi is no longer at Luoxia Manor.

00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:28.417
I don't know where he is either.

00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:31.417
You go deal with Chu Qiu first.

00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:33.937
Then go look for Bizhi.

00:18:34.937 --> 00:18:35.496
Alright.

00:18:36.496 --> 00:18:37.457
I promise you.

00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:39.977
As long as you don't betray me,

00:18:41.296 --> 00:18:42.496
I won't betray you either.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:45.056
(No choice.)

00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:47.977
(It seems I can only protect Bizhi
by staying with her.)

00:19:02.217 --> 00:19:03.096
Have you found him?

00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:03.697
No.

00:19:03.697 --> 00:19:04.657
Keep searching.

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:07.536
How big can Tianguang Market be?

00:19:07.977 --> 00:19:09.496
I'll find him.

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:10.137
Yes.

00:19:34.644 --> 00:19:35.311
Stop right there!

00:20:12.016 --> 00:20:12.857
Su Beilu.

00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:14.417
Why are you here?

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.320
We'll catch up later.
Leave this place first.

00:20:16.377 --> 00:20:16.776
Go.

00:20:18.496 --> 00:20:19.217
This way.

00:20:33.977 --> 00:20:35.256
How did you get here?

00:20:35.816 --> 00:20:36.889
I used a few tricks.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:37.777
Don't worry about it.

00:20:37.816 --> 00:20:38.657
Listen.

00:20:38.816 --> 00:20:40.377
Miss Ye came looking for me, too.

00:20:40.617 --> 00:20:41.857
She even tried to kill me.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.570
I guessed something had happened to you.

00:20:45.617 --> 00:20:46.377
I'm sorry

00:20:46.377 --> 00:20:47.256
I got you involved.

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:48.377
Don't say that.

00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:49.776
I came to help you.

00:20:49.857 --> 00:20:50.457
Tell me.

00:20:50.536 --> 00:20:51.417
What should we do?

00:20:53.897 --> 00:20:54.857
You can't stay here.

00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:55.890
I'll send you back first.

00:20:56.016 --> 00:20:56.857
Bizhi, don't.

00:20:57.016 --> 00:20:57.657
Move aside!

00:20:57.937 --> 00:20:58.457
Bizhi!

00:20:58.576 --> 00:20:59.657
I can't go back.

00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:02.177
Why?

00:21:07.536 --> 00:21:10.177
I discovered the entrance
to Tianguang Market

00:21:10.177 --> 00:21:11.776
in a place deep in the mountains.

00:21:12.177 --> 00:21:13.377
Passing through the dense fog,

00:21:13.688 --> 00:21:14.690
I finally arrived here.

00:21:15.977 --> 00:21:17.897
If you send me back through Yashe,

00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:19.688
it will cause a space-time disorder.

00:21:24.296 --> 00:21:25.016
Look.

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:26.937
I even know things like this now.

00:21:27.256 --> 00:21:28.816
I've really grown a lot.

00:21:29.217 --> 00:21:30.056
They all say

00:21:30.377 --> 00:21:32.010
I'm becoming more and more like you.

00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:34.977
I'm no longer that

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:36.217
clueless,

00:21:36.217 --> 00:21:37.857
good-for-nothing junior employee.

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:40.536
I can stand on my own now.

00:21:41.256 --> 00:21:43.096
I can help you fulfill your wish, too.

00:21:43.816 --> 00:21:44.816
Believe me.

00:21:52.697 --> 00:21:53.496
You said

00:21:55.096 --> 00:21:56.217
I'm your friend.

00:21:59.016 --> 00:22:01.096
So I won't let you face this alone.

00:22:03.177 --> 00:22:04.417
This time,

00:22:05.137 --> 00:22:06.417
let me go with you.

00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:13.016
No.

00:22:14.217 --> 00:22:15.897
You can't come with me this time.

00:22:19.576 --> 00:22:21.816
You have something more important to do.

00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:48.217
Miss Ye.

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:49.417
Is there a problem?

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:52.217
That guy may have escaped.

00:22:52.457 --> 00:22:53.617
Confirm whether this place

00:22:53.617 --> 00:22:54.736
is a transit point.

00:22:54.897 --> 00:22:55.256
Yes.

00:23:07.296 --> 00:23:07.969
Miss Ye.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.090
This is indeed a transit point
for the time elevator.

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:11.266
The elevator just left.

00:23:11.377 --> 00:23:12.657
Track the coordinates.

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:13.137
Yes.

00:23:25.816 --> 00:23:26.417
Miss Ye.

00:23:26.511 --> 00:23:27.866
We've found the final coordinates.

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:29.617
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go.

00:23:31.016 --> 00:23:31.736
Oh right.

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:33.576
Bring that girl along.

00:23:33.576 --> 00:23:34.857
She's still useful to us.

00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:35.897
Besides,

00:23:36.177 --> 00:23:38.296
she probably wants
to see her good friend.

00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:38.857
Yes.

00:23:47.016 --> 00:23:47.697
Young Master.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.890
The wind and snow seem
to be getting heavier.

00:23:49.955 --> 00:23:52.088
Shall we move to
Her Majesty's room to warm up?

00:23:52.617 --> 00:23:53.697
You may leave.

00:23:54.377 --> 00:23:55.217
I'm not cold.

00:23:56.096 --> 00:23:57.096
Yes.

00:24:24.177 --> 00:24:25.016
Caiwei?

00:24:25.977 --> 00:24:26.937
What happened?

00:24:28.816 --> 00:24:29.496
Young Master.

00:24:29.733 --> 00:24:30.977
Please come with me, quickly.

00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:33.256
Why?

00:24:33.417 --> 00:24:35.256
I was entrusted by Young Master Bizhi

00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:36.776
to retrieve your Dushan Jade.

00:24:36.776 --> 00:24:37.857
It was to serve as a token,

00:24:37.857 --> 00:24:39.256
to seek Lord Sima's protection.

00:24:39.355 --> 00:24:40.266
But just now,

00:24:40.266 --> 00:24:43.133
I tried to enter the residence under
the pretext of delivering charcoal,

00:24:43.217 --> 00:24:44.776
to take the jade out,

00:24:44.937 --> 00:24:47.417
yet the guards wouldn't let me in.

00:24:48.457 --> 00:24:49.296
At present,

00:24:49.417 --> 00:24:50.336
your residence

00:24:50.417 --> 00:24:52.457
allows no contact
with the outside at all.

00:24:53.256 --> 00:24:54.937
This is no small matter.

00:24:56.256 --> 00:24:58.096
I fear for your safety.

00:24:58.776 --> 00:24:59.857
I beg you,

00:24:59.857 --> 00:25:00.857
please flee at once.

00:25:05.016 --> 00:25:06.096
I see.

00:25:07.897 --> 00:25:09.857
So Bizhi has planned so much for me.

00:25:10.937 --> 00:25:12.096
He's gone to great lengths.

00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:15.736
Caiwei,

00:25:16.496 --> 00:25:17.496
come with me.

00:25:36.822 --> 00:25:39.010
Yesterday, more guards
were added to the residence.

00:25:39.336 --> 00:25:41.336
I am no different from being imprisoned.

00:25:42.137 --> 00:25:43.697
You must take the Dushan Jade out

00:25:43.897 --> 00:25:44.937
and deliver it to Bizhi.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.250
What about you, Young Master?

00:25:47.897 --> 00:25:49.256
Among the newly assigned guards,

00:25:49.857 --> 00:25:52.056
there are those from Lord Sima's
residence as well.

00:25:52.977 --> 00:25:54.377
Is Lord Sima

00:25:55.056 --> 00:25:56.217
one of them, too?

00:25:57.977 --> 00:25:59.010
That remains uncertain.

00:25:59.777 --> 00:26:01.410
But the more chaotic the situation,

00:26:01.897 --> 00:26:03.256
the more I must stay behind.

00:26:04.137 --> 00:26:04.816
Go, quickly.

00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:05.617
Young Master.

00:26:07.937 --> 00:26:10.217
I'll be more at ease if the jade
is in Bizhi's hands.

00:26:10.377 --> 00:26:11.217
Young Master.

00:26:11.496 --> 00:26:12.096
Young Master.

00:26:12.096 --> 00:26:12.816
Caiwei.

00:26:13.137 --> 00:26:14.217
Given Bizhi's character,

00:26:14.736 --> 00:26:16.657
he's already set out
to find evidence for me.

00:26:17.657 --> 00:26:18.417
Go now.

00:26:31.417 --> 00:26:32.496
Be careful in everything.

00:26:39.576 --> 00:26:40.177
Yes.

00:26:42.336 --> 00:26:43.417
Take care, Young Master.

00:27:34.457 --> 00:27:35.096
Su Rou.

00:27:52.177 --> 00:27:54.576
(A trusted confidant has already
turned traitor.)

00:27:56.177 --> 00:27:58.570
(I, a crown prince who sought
no conflict with the world,)

00:27:58.776 --> 00:28:01.096
(have somehow become intolerable
to the world.)

00:28:02.056 --> 00:28:03.857
(And those who plotted on my behalf,)

00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:06.177
(how utterly innocent they are.)

00:29:21.977 --> 00:29:24.336
(We travel a thousand miles apart,)

00:29:25.977 --> 00:29:28.137
(mountains upon mountains
divide our old forest.)

00:29:30.897 --> 00:29:33.137
(The old forest can no longer be seen,)

00:29:35.256 --> 00:29:38.137
(old friends dwell alone
in deep thought.)

00:29:39.617 --> 00:29:42.217
(All my life bound by a single resolve,)

00:29:43.496 --> 00:29:44.657
(a thousand miles apart,)

00:29:44.977 --> 00:29:46.776
(each walking our own path.)

00:30:16.377 --> 00:30:17.457
Where is

00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:19.536
the Dushan Jade?

00:30:28.137 --> 00:30:29.617
You came to kill me, didn't you?

00:30:35.977 --> 00:30:37.177
Tell your master,

00:30:38.977 --> 00:30:40.657
there is no need for such trouble.

00:30:46.617 --> 00:30:48.617
My ancestors passed
the Dushan Jade down to me.

00:30:50.857 --> 00:30:52.177
To cherish virtue and hold jade,

00:30:54.937 --> 00:30:57.417
yet fail to bring peace and abundance.

00:31:02.417 --> 00:31:04.417
One should not take water
in motion as a mirror,

00:31:05.937 --> 00:31:07.496
but still water instead.

00:31:17.137 --> 00:31:17.937
I ask you,

00:31:18.457 --> 00:31:19.296
where exactly is

00:31:19.776 --> 00:31:20.697
the Dushan Jade?

00:31:23.137 --> 00:31:24.816
You will never

00:31:25.256 --> 00:31:28.377
ever obtain the Dushan Jade...

00:31:28.816 --> 00:31:29.617
You...

00:32:06.277 --> 00:32:09.397
(Yashe)

00:32:17.688 --> 00:32:20.355
Fusheng Hall has already taken control
of Tianguang Market.

00:32:20.576 --> 00:32:21.496
We need to find a way

00:32:21.496 --> 00:32:22.857
to notify the Time Administration.

00:32:23.377 --> 00:32:25.816
But before that, there's something
I need to confirm.

00:32:27.444 --> 00:32:28.850
The one who killed Young Master Qin

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.777
was very likely an assassin
from Fusheng Hall.

00:32:31.096 --> 00:32:32.217
They are like me,

00:32:32.536 --> 00:32:33.617
all from the future.

00:32:34.657 --> 00:32:36.857
Their ultimate goal
is to seize the Dushan Jade.

00:32:37.417 --> 00:32:38.977
If I can make it

00:32:38.977 --> 00:32:40.377
before sunset,

00:32:40.816 --> 00:32:42.736
then perhaps I can save Caiwei's life.

00:32:55.496 --> 00:32:56.296
Set off.

00:33:19.377 --> 00:33:20.096
Sir.

00:33:20.417 --> 00:33:21.536
Can you go any faster?

00:33:40.016 --> 00:33:41.096
What's happened?

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:46.137
Sir.

00:33:47.697 --> 00:33:48.496
Sir.

00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:25.377
Watch out!

00:34:37.297 --> 00:34:38.297
Young Master Bizhi!

00:34:38.897 --> 00:34:40.257
You're from Fusheng Hall?

00:34:40.616 --> 00:34:41.457
Who are you?

00:34:41.696 --> 00:34:42.754
Was Young Master Qin,

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.555
the owner of the Dushan Jade
killed by you?

00:34:44.644 --> 00:34:45.850
Why should I tell you?

00:34:48.911 --> 00:34:50.888
That young master drank poison
and killed himself.

00:34:50.911 --> 00:34:52.170
I saw it with my own eyes!

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.410
What does it have to do with me?

00:34:53.417 --> 00:34:54.337
You're lying!

00:34:54.897 --> 00:34:56.817
How exactly did he die?

00:34:59.417 --> 00:35:00.216
Let him go!

00:35:18.496 --> 00:35:19.457
Why are you here?

00:35:22.977 --> 00:35:23.857
Why?

00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:26.536
Chasing me all the way
from Tianguang Market.

00:35:26.737 --> 00:35:28.176
You're really relentless.

00:35:36.437 --> 00:35:39.877
(During the Wanqi Era)
(Miao Village before the plague)

00:35:58.536 --> 00:35:59.937
These are all fine goods.

00:36:09.857 --> 00:36:10.897
The cauldron's here!

00:36:18.737 --> 00:36:19.696
Grave robbing?

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.111
How come you lost your memory,
but your skills are still so good?

00:36:26.377 --> 00:36:26.937
Who are you?

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.022
Untie me first, and then I'll tell you.

00:36:36.096 --> 00:36:37.136
My name is Su Beilu.

00:36:37.417 --> 00:36:38.257
I'm your friend.

00:36:38.576 --> 00:36:39.777
Su Beilu?

00:36:40.737 --> 00:36:41.576
A friend?

00:36:41.696 --> 00:36:42.096
Yes.

00:36:42.656 --> 00:36:43.649
Your name is Chu Qiu.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.050
You're a commissioner of
Time Administration from the future.

00:36:46.056 --> 00:36:47.096
I came to find you.

00:36:47.616 --> 00:36:49.496
You have something more important to do.

00:36:49.616 --> 00:36:50.616
What do I need to do?

00:36:51.216 --> 00:36:52.176
Change the future.

00:36:54.056 --> 00:36:55.096
Those grave robbers

00:36:55.444 --> 00:36:57.088
are from Fusheng Hall in the future.

00:36:57.377 --> 00:36:59.176
They're the ones who erased your memory,

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:00.377
and dumped you here.

00:37:01.817 --> 00:37:02.696
I came to find you

00:37:02.733 --> 00:37:05.150
because I need your help
with something extremely important.

00:37:05.496 --> 00:37:06.297
What was that sound?

00:37:09.216 --> 00:37:10.817
There's been movement nearby lately.

00:37:10.977 --> 00:37:12.417
Could it be villagers?

00:37:13.576 --> 00:37:14.696
That shouldn't be.

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:16.250
This ancient tomb is forbidden ground.

00:37:16.377 --> 00:37:18.176
Ordinary people wouldn't dare come here.

00:37:18.937 --> 00:37:21.016
There are plenty of antiques
in this royal tomb.

00:37:21.022 --> 00:37:22.777
They can't be moved out
in just a day or two.

00:37:22.777 --> 00:37:24.536
If the nearby villagers discover this,

00:37:24.666 --> 00:37:25.890
we'll be in serious trouble.

00:37:26.737 --> 00:37:28.136
According to the authority,

00:37:28.857 --> 00:37:30.016
leave no survivors.

00:37:30.777 --> 00:37:31.536
Another massacre?

00:37:33.536 --> 00:37:35.176
We do all the dirty work,

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.511
and they still won't pay more.

00:37:36.696 --> 00:37:37.897
Seriously.

00:37:38.257 --> 00:37:40.016
Hurry and pack up. Let's go.

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:41.136
Careful.

00:37:44.576 --> 00:37:45.377
You can't go.

00:37:45.377 --> 00:37:47.644
Why can't I go? They're going
to wipe out the village.

00:37:47.688 --> 00:37:49.088
We have more important things to do.

00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:09.337
Bizhi guessed right.

00:38:09.696 --> 00:38:11.297
They poisoned the well.

00:38:11.297 --> 00:38:13.656
That's why the plague broke out,
and everyone died.

00:38:14.056 --> 00:38:15.056
That's outrageous.

00:38:17.737 --> 00:38:18.457
You can't go.

00:38:18.576 --> 00:38:19.817
That would change history.

00:38:20.266 --> 00:38:21.690
Stop blocking me or I'll hit you.

00:38:21.696 --> 00:38:22.937
You really can't go.

00:38:46.656 --> 00:38:47.536
You beast!

00:38:47.817 --> 00:38:48.696
Where's the antidote?

00:38:49.016 --> 00:38:49.536
Careful!

00:38:49.536 --> 00:38:50.417
Where's the antidote?

00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:06.377
Bizhi.

00:39:06.576 --> 00:39:07.136
I...

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:08.377
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:39:09.257 --> 00:39:10.337
Protecting yourself

00:39:10.737 --> 00:39:12.176
was the right choice.

00:39:14.297 --> 00:39:15.857
I never thought we'd meet again

00:39:16.337 --> 00:39:17.817
in such a place.

00:39:18.216 --> 00:39:19.777
Your people killed my friend.

00:39:20.696 --> 00:39:21.576
I want revenge.

00:39:21.576 --> 00:39:22.576
I already said...

00:39:23.817 --> 00:39:24.536
Tell him.

00:39:27.977 --> 00:39:28.857
I said it before,

00:39:30.817 --> 00:39:32.536
that young master was not killed by me.

00:39:41.696 --> 00:39:42.817
See?

00:39:43.016 --> 00:39:44.576
What he said is the truth.

00:39:48.257 --> 00:39:50.176
This person is injured.

00:39:50.937 --> 00:39:52.016
Take him away.

00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:54.696
Why?

00:39:55.216 --> 00:39:56.056
Why?

00:39:59.656 --> 00:40:00.576
Young Master Bizhi.

00:40:02.496 --> 00:40:05.576
Is what they said true?

00:40:06.297 --> 00:40:08.096
Why would my young master
take his own life?

00:40:12.417 --> 00:40:15.457
So Ziyi had long prepared
to sacrifice himself.

00:40:16.337 --> 00:40:19.056
Yet, he clearly told me
to bring the Dushan Jade to you.

00:40:20.216 --> 00:40:22.337
I thought he had a way
to protect himself.

00:40:22.737 --> 00:40:24.897
He never thought of protecting himself,

00:40:25.817 --> 00:40:27.457
but of protecting others.

00:40:28.937 --> 00:40:30.817
For that, he was willing
to sacrifice himself.

00:40:31.937 --> 00:40:33.096
It's just that this jade

00:40:34.016 --> 00:40:35.857
embodies the noble spirit
of the Qin family,

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:37.530
and the integrity of its lineage.

00:40:38.555 --> 00:40:41.133
He couldn't bear to let it
fall into villainous hands.

00:40:42.056 --> 00:40:43.737
Only today did I truly understand.

00:40:45.136 --> 00:40:45.897
It's too late.

00:40:49.496 --> 00:40:50.536
Young Master...

00:40:52.576 --> 00:40:53.937
Very well.

00:40:54.377 --> 00:40:57.297
The Dushan Jade truly
is a priceless treasure.

00:40:57.737 --> 00:40:59.297
I want to tell this story properly

00:40:59.496 --> 00:41:00.536
to the clients

00:41:00.536 --> 00:41:02.937
at the auction.

00:41:05.457 --> 00:41:06.257
Miss,

00:41:06.977 --> 00:41:08.257
hand over the Dushan Jade.

00:41:19.737 --> 00:41:20.496
Miss Ye.

00:41:21.056 --> 00:41:22.937
They're not from
the Time Administration.

00:41:22.937 --> 00:41:24.056
They won't threaten you.

00:41:24.457 --> 00:41:25.696
Bizhi's involvement

00:41:25.696 --> 00:41:26.857
was just an accident.

00:41:27.257 --> 00:41:29.616
And you promised
you wouldn't harm Bizhi.

00:41:30.216 --> 00:41:31.496
On the condition

00:41:32.136 --> 00:41:33.777
that he hands over the Dushan Jade.

00:41:35.457 --> 00:41:37.096
Is that jade really that important?

00:41:38.777 --> 00:41:39.817
Of course it is.

00:41:40.536 --> 00:41:42.056
It's the final treasure

00:41:42.056 --> 00:41:44.136
of this Fusheng Hall auction.

00:41:44.857 --> 00:41:46.696
If you keep getting in my way,

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:48.457
I won't be polite.

00:41:48.777 --> 00:41:50.216
You promised me.

00:41:50.897 --> 00:41:52.297
People who recklessly take lives

00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:54.096
have no sense of morality.

00:41:56.696 --> 00:41:58.616
Do those who deceived you

00:41:59.257 --> 00:42:00.417
have morality?

00:42:06.616 --> 00:42:08.777
So you won't hand over
the Dushan Jade, right?

00:42:11.257 --> 00:42:11.777
Li.

00:42:20.777 --> 00:42:21.297
Wait.

00:42:26.576 --> 00:42:27.176
Caiwei.

00:42:28.257 --> 00:42:29.417
Give it to me.

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:00.737
What are you doing?

00:43:01.016 --> 00:43:02.377
Put down all your weapons.

00:43:03.016 --> 00:43:03.817
Otherwise,

00:43:04.576 --> 00:43:05.737
the Dushan Jade shatters.
