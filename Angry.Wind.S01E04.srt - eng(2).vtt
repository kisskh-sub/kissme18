WEBVTT

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.920
Nanfeng

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.000
The room is a bit dark

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.760
I want to sleep with you

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.440
Hey, Xu Rumeng, you...

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
Nanfeng, what's wrong?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.600
Did I hurt you?

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.560
Let me rub it for you

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.480
No, no, no, Xu Rumeng

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.080
We’ve been apart for quite a long time

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.800
We can’t go back

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.200
The one I love now is Zhou Zhiyi

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.640
I know feelings can be rebuilt

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.760
I’ll give you time

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.680
Is one hour enough?

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.200
Hey

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.440
No, Xu Rumeng

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.000
If Zhou Zhiyi finds out you came this late,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.680
will she throw you out?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.040
Why would she kick me out?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.200
You’re not her husband

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.680
Zheng Nanfeng

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.800
I just...

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.680
You, you...

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.800
What are you doing?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.240
Come here

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.240
Come here

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.960
Come here

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.600
What’s that sound?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600
Are you okay?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.800
I’m fine. Hold on a sec

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.480
Don’t move

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.480
Shh

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.280
Hi

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.000
Uh, oh, well...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I was just watching TV

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.400
Did I bother you?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.800
Oh, not at all

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.360
It’s just too much happened these past two days

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.560
I’m having trouble sleeping

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.480
Came to have a drink with you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.480
Have a drink

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.000
Right, we should have a drink

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.600
Uh, let’s drink in the living room

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.480
Then we have it, don’t we?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.280
Ah

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.480
Zheng Nanfeng

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.880
Xu Rumeng is a good person

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.840
You can tell she really likes you

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.600
If you’re together, communicate well

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.680
Act like a proper boyfriend

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.080
No, the two of us aren’t dating

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.840
What’s that noise?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.280
Oh, um...

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.000
Your cat is catching mice

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.360
I don’t have a cat

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.200
You’re talking nonsense

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.000
Zheng Nanfeng

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.760
Why are you different from others?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.960
Am I?

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600
The way you think about things

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.480
always surprises me

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.680
And

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.320
your understanding of me

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.240
seems deeper than others’

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.560
I...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.360
know far more than you

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.640
You’ve only known me for a few days

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.440
I’ve known you for a long time

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.600
A very long time

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.840
Stop

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.520
You say you went into his room

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520
because you couldn’t sleep at midnight,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.960
to have a drink with him, right?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.760
You say you went into his room

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.680
also to look for a drink

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.560
Then you drink too

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.600
Hey, hey, let’s not drink like this, okay?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.600
I don’t buy that you hid in the curtains

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.440
just like that

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.000
Since I don’t believe it, have another drink

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.600
You just said he’s different because of his work

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.040
I don’t believe that either

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.800
Then you deserve a penalty drink too

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.360
What, you two think I’m invisible?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.240
Then you drink

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.360
Bottoms up

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.840
Drink

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.960
Xu Rumeng

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.360
You're good at singing and dancing

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.760
I'm telling you

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.640
In less than five years you'll be an A-list star

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.760
A-list star

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.200
What's an A-list star?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.800
An A-list star is a top-tier celebrity

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.360
When did you switch to being a fortune-teller?

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.440
Zhou Zhiyi, you too

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600
Five years

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400
We...

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.080
We...

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.000
Hey

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.840
Don't fall asleep, you two

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440
Keep drinking

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.880
Zheng Nanfeng

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.120
Sister Zhiyi

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.600
I'm sorry

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.560
You really guessed right

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.200
She really had a motive

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.880
Ever since you came back from seeing your sister today,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.200
I felt something was off with you

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.000
Tell me, who made you do this?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.360
You stole the song

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.000
Are you going to hand it to Xie Jiachang?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.480
Xu Rumeng, tell me the truth

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.200
Is your stealing the cassette tape related to Xie Jiachang?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.600
Fine, if we tied the wrong person, then so be it

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.680
Call Xu Rumeng

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.840
Tell her to go steal the cassette tape back for me

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.400
If she doesn't agree,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.360
don't blame me if I torture her for 49 days

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.880
So right now you...

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.160
still don't know where Youyou is?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.560
I was saying, Xie Jiachang

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.160
has been so quiet these days

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.880
I'll call now to get her

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.840
Snatch her back

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.600
Don't worry

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.800
No, doing that will tip off the enemy

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.840
Given his nature, he'll likely kill the hostage

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.880
Then what do you think we should do?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.000
You have to bait the hook to catch the fish

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.920
Take it to ransom her

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.000
Go back and sleep

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.600
Um

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.160
Which side do I sleep on?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.040
You sleep outside

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.080
Hey, hey

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.760
Where's my sister?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.640
Wait a minute

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.080
That's enough

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.000
Got the stuff

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.720
As agreed,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.560
You get the goods

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.520
Release my sister

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.840
Boss

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.400
What does Track Sequence mean?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.440
This is Zheng Nanfeng

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.400
based on Music Psychology

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.000
a researched music playback order

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.560
It says to play in sequence

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.080
It better stimulates customers' emotions

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.400
Brother Jie, go try it

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.040
Okay

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.600
That's the vibe

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200
Where is my sister?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.160
I did say I'd release your sister,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.800
but now isn't the time

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.360
Xie Jiachang, you don't keep your word

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.200
What do you want?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.200
What do I want?

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.080
Just having the songs isn't enough

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.800
You have to be my lead dancer

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.880
I'm not going

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.800
If you want to save your sister, do as I say

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.480
Otherwise, you know the consequences

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.920
Xie Jiachang, release my sister!

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.000
You jerk

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.000
Louder

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.040
Get hyped

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.440
Sister Zhiyi

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.120
Zheng Nanfeng

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.000
After Xu Rumeng went over

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
She was detained by the people there

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.360
I have already sent someone to follow them

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.400
I told you Xie Jiachang is unpredictable

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.840
Even with the cassette tape, he might not release her

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.640
Right?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.800
Given Xie Jiachang's character,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.600
If he let her go,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600
I would find that strange

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.600
Ah

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.240
Then you still sent Xu Rumeng to deliver the cassette tape?

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.640
It is dangerous for the girl being held

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.600
Don't worry

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.440
Xu Rumeng is the club's Top performer

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.160
Xie Jiachang will not lay a hand on her

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.200
If you do not let Xie Jiachang get a taste,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.440
How will he lower his guard?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.640
He lowers his guard, and then what?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.200
One day later, Club A8 closes

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.560
Make him close down

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.040
He is deeply entrenched in Haicheng

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.080
Easier said than done

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.400
It really is not easy

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.280
Otherwise, why would you need me?

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.800
You mean,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.880
you have already arranged everything

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.880
A Ming

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.400
Yeah?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.760
Go check where he is holding Youyou

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.840
Get the exact location

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.200
Tell me at once if there is any news

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.000
Go right now

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.800
Yeah, okay

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.800
If I remember correctly

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.640
Tomorrow night, Master Qin

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.800
is coming to our club for his birthday banquet

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.600
Right?

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.440
Mm-hmm

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.800
I miss you

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.720
Whenever dusk falls

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.600
The night breeze rises

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.440
I miss you

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.440
The riddle of life

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.560
Try not to see it clearly

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.960
Close your eyes

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.160
Do not respond

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.160
The night wind blows and blows

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.840
Go with the wind

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.280
Tonight, children, do not secretly cry

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.440
Do not secretly cry

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.280
The night wind blows and blows

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.960
Go with the wind

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.120
With the starry nightfall

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.120
Gently fall asleep

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.560
Breathe the night wind
