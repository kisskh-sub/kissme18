Go.

Go.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.000
Go!

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.160
How dare you!

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.800
Please spare us!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.720
Please spare us!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.320
Useless!

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.040
By order of the Prime Minister,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.800
even the Crown Prince

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.640
must die.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.480
His Majesty and the Crown Prince
were assassinated.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.320
Prime Minister Qiu Xuanling

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.360
arrived too late to save them.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.000
We only captured the assassin.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.280
And this assassin

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.000
is none other than the son
of the criminal Shen Jinyuan,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.960
Shen Zhifeng.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.080
To avenge his father,

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.200
Shen Zhifeng assassinated the Emperor.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.600
His crime warrants death.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.240
Tomorrow in court,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.640
Prime Minister Qiu Xuanling

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.080
will execute him on the spot.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.800
And the child

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.520
in your womb

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.560
will be the sole royal heir.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.800
You will be

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.800
the Empress Dowager,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.280
ruling from behind the curtain.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.840
You're hesitating.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.240
I'm one step away

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.640
from the imperial throne.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.080
Why would I hesitate?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600
An unborn child as royal heir

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.280
hasn't occurred

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.280
since the Xiakang era.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.160
My plan this time

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200
is quite inspired
by antiquity, isn't it?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.160
At tomorrow's court session,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.360
this throne

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.880
will change hands.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.720
Everyone,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.720
His Majesty and the Crown Prince

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.320
were assassinated

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.240
last night.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.760
Both have perished.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.200
But fortunately,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.240
the assassin
was captured alive on the spot.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.360
The child in the Crown Princess' womb

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.760
is the sole remaining royal heir.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.840
The Crown Princess should act as regent

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.000
until the royal heir is born.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.560
Everyone,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.240
any objections?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.200
I object!

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520
A fetus on the throne?

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.360
Unheard of!

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.000
You're acting

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.640
like a treacherous villain!

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.840
His Majesty
and the Crown Prince are dead.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.480
The Crown Princess is my daughter.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.560
I am the royal father-in-law!

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.560
You.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.920
You.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.720
Who dares call me

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.080
a treacherous villain now?

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.320
Treacherous villain!

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.120
You!

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.400
You're still alive?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.040
You're utterly lawless.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.280
Qiu Xuanling.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.760
Look.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.040
Know what this is?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.600
Everyone,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.160
this is

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.440
evidence collected
years ago by Shen Jinyuan

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.800
of Qiu Xuanling's imperial exam fraud

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.440
and corruption of the court!

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.880
And you still deny
being a treacherous villain?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
What a joke.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.160
The words of that criminal Shen Jinyuan

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.640
cannot be trusted.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.560
The evidence is here.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.880
What other excuses do you have?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.880
I'll restore justice for the Shens.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.600
Now, I ask you.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920
Who truly

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.160
caused my father's death?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.880
Your father

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.040
was killed by this assassin,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.680
Shen Zhifeng.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.440
Shen Zhifeng is right here.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.040
Why execute him without trial?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.600
Do you intend to silence him

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.800
in front of everyone?

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760
Your Highness,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.840
I'm loyal.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.880
Why slander me so?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.840
Could it be...

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.760
that your delusional episode
has recurred?

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.560
Ridiculous!

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.920
Qiu Xuanling, I'm warning you!

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.720
I am still here.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.960
She is

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.160
unworthy of the throne.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.360
Guards.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.120
His Highness' delusional episode
has recurred.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.280
Escort His Highness to his palace.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.240
Who dares?

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.200
Her child is not the royal heir.

00:08:25.728 --> 00:08:26.200
I am...

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.720
How dare you!

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.600
How dare a child of a disgraced minister
spout nonsense here!

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.680
I shall execute you this instant!

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.920
Kill me.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.120
Then you cannot kill him.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.240
Have you forgotten

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.200
what I have taught you

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.640
through the years?

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.800
