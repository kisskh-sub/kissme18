[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.850
[Episode 18]

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.229
Once I showed my true form

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.120
they all ran away, scared.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.650
But I didn't mean to.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.840
It's okay.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.400
You were trying to protect everyone.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.860
They all understand that.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.870
Then...

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.340
will anyone
still play jianzi with me?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.880
Of course.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.400
I'll play with you.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.870
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.079
Let me tell you something.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.740
I know an old demon
who's thousands of years old.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.470
He taught me that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.550
seeing isn't always believing.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.750
Many things need to be felt from here

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.079
to be truly understood.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.430
And I can feel that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.360
you're just as kind-hearted

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.190
as him.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.960
By the way,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.520
why do you love
playing jianzi so much?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.630
Because of Jin Ge.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.310
Jin Ge?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.190
She's my friend, just like you all.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.430
My mission from heaven

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.070
is to guard the Kunlun Mirror fragments
on Mount Qiansui.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.710
I've been guarding this mountain
for thousands of years,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.440
and it's been terribly lonely.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.520
A thousand years ago,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.180
I couldn't resist taking human form
and coming down the mountain.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.400
Throw it to me!

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.870
To me!

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.160
Pass it here!

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.310
To me!

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.190
Pass it!

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.360
Kick it to me!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
Kick it over here!

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.320
Can I play with you?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.280
Go away!

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.730
That looks fun! Could you teach me?

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.910
Line up!

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.910
Mount up!

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.520
-Go! Go!
-Attack!

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.500
Hit him!

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.079
-Go!
-Go! Go!

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.840
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.560
Get him!

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.280
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.030
I don't want to play anymore.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.630
I'm too tired.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.710
I'm always the horse!

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.870
I'm always the horse!

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.600
I quit.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.680
I'll be the horse!

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.400
Let me join you!

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.240
Who's this stranger?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.960
Go away!

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.470
Come on, come on.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.280
I can do it.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.750
Come.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.590
Line up.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.580
Mount up.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.430
Attack!

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.190
Hit him.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.030
Go.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.960
Charge.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.630
Hurry.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.840
Hit him, hit him.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.470
Go.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.150
Attack.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.000
Hit him quickly.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.630
Hurry up.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.150
Hit him now.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.560
Go get him.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.190
Lansheng, dinner's ready!

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.950
Time to eat!

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.870
Come home for dinner!

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.630
Come back now.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.510
Hurry up.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.950
Come back quickly.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.750
Dinner time.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.950
Who are you?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.120
I'm Jin Ge.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.870
And you?

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.360
Why are you sad?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.630
Is someone bullying you?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.600
Nobody wants to play with me.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.430
I can play with you.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.480
More.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.900
Are you hidden?

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.570
I'm coming to find you!

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.800
Found you!

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.010
Why are you crying?

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.690
Without realizing it,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.430
it's all dark already.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.070
I came here

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.920
to find fragments
of the ancient Kunlun Mirror.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.640
If I can't find them,

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.870
I won't be able to return.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.590
Then that's perfect!

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.190
You can keep playing with me.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.420
But I'll die that way.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.680
Why?

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.040
I was originally a mayfly,

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.800
with only one day to live.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.600
I never knew what was dawn

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.510
or dusk.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.400
After touching a drop of immortal dew,

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.570
I accidentally achieved human form.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.870
But my lifespan is only one year,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.310
and 11 months have already passed.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.510
I'll die soon.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.360
Unless...

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.290
you can drink from the Yuli Spring?

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.120
Since achieving human form,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.360
I've been searching for the fragments
of the ancient Kunlun Mirror.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.800
Only by collecting all the fragments

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.560
can I find the Yuli Spring.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.310
I've gathered seven pieces now,

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.870
but I can't find the last one.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.360
I'll die soon.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.880
With me here, you absolutely won't die.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.200
Here's the eighth piece.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.870
You are Taotie?

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.270
Yes.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.920
Once I find the celestial mountain

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.950
and drink from the Yuli Spring,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.789
I'll come back
to play with you right away.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.600
It's a deal.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.080
But what if when I return,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.510
you've already grown up,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.770
and I can't recognize you anymore?

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.960
I'll stay looking just like this

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.160
and wait for you here.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.150
Okay.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.570
Just see me off here.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.480
You should change your name.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.240
With a new name,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.550
humans will be willing to play with you.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.960
Change to what?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.320
How about Zixiu?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:10.960
Okay.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.840
Zixiu, practice playing jianzi well.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.050
We'll compete again when I return.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.000
Okay!

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.550
Once you become immortal
like heaven and earth,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.670
we can play together forever.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.750
It's a promise.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.210
I gave the ancient mirror
to Jin Ge without permission.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.960
I deserve to be punished,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.630
but I promised I would wait for her here.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.150
So, for a thousand years,

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.480
there has only been Zixiu, not Taotie.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.660
You really believe she'll come back?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.600
I promised to wait for her, so I must.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.210
Will you keep waiting forever?

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.030
Yes.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.670
But Jin Ge

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.630
has already reached the celestial mountain

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.360
and drunk from the Yuli Spring.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.280
You know better than anyone

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.030
that she won't come back.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.630
I promised to wait for her.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.040
You also came to Mount Qiansui
for the mirror fragments?

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.270
Yes.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.690
But there aren't any left here.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.040
It's alright.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.600
Zixiu protected us,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.510
and that's why we survived.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.080
Although we can't stay

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.870
and play with you forever,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.120
we can teach you some new games.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.600
Really?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.320
Really.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:54.910
"We?"

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.960
One, two, three,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.030
freeze!

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.360
One, two, three, freeze!

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.910
One, two, three, freeze!

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.840
One, two, three, freeze!

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.360
Xiao Yao,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.080
are you scared?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.390
No!

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.150
Higher!

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.150
Don't let that stinky man touch you!

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.630
Higher!

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.550
I have to go now.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.170
Thank you for playing with me.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.960
This is the second happiest day

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.560
I've had in a thousand years.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.110
The happiest

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.080
was the day I met Jin Ge.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.770
But by tomorrow,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.480
today will become the happiest.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.240
Tomorrow will be
exactly one thousand years, right?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:05.790
Yes.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.350
I can't wait for Jin Ge anymore.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.960
Time's up.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.610
I must go face my punishment now.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.930
Xiao Yao,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.960
if someday

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.580
you reach the celestial mountain

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.450
and see Jin Ge,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.720
could you

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.990
tell her something for me?

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.840
Go ahead.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:48.090
I've gotten even better
at jianzi than before.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.510
I'll definitely tell her.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.690
Isn't the Kunlun Mirror gone?

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.310
This fragment must have been left
by Taotie's lingering obsession.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.270
Life has Eight Sufferings:

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.790
Birth, Aging, Sickness, Death,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.990
Love and Separation,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.320
Lasting Resentment,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.340
Unattainable Desire,
and Unresolved Attachment.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.580
This must be his Unresolved Attachment.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.700
Everyone says Taotie was vicious,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.350
but he actually sealed himself
in such a small form

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.790
for one thousand years

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.390
so Jin Ge could recognize him

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.420
when she returned.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.100
That Jin Ge...

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.170
I've heard

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.450
that a thousand years ago,
Dreamshard gathered

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.880
the fragments of the Kunlun Mirror

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.080
to save someone she loved.
Jin Ge must be her incarnation,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.410
who tricked Taotie
and took the mirror fragment he guarded.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.960
Oh, Zixiu...

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.280
Did she manage to save her lover?

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.360
It was just a trap set by her lover.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.840
His purpose

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.850
was to obtain the Kunlun Mirror

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.410
and claim credit from the emperor.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.440
After Dreamshard learned the truth,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.670
she melted her heart into a crystal heart,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.200
transformed into a spirit,

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.010
and killed the traitor's entire family.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.130
Only then did she
transcend the Three Realms

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.490
and create this Realm of Mist and Void.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.360
How pitiful.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.450
Therefore,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.180
when you meet Dreamshard,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.230
don't make any moves.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.290
Just observe quietly.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.480
What are you planning to do?

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.210
Don't worry.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.750
No matter what I do,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.230
it won't involve you.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.920
Don't do anything foolish.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.510
I know my limits.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.880
We have retrieved the mirror fragment.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.740
Please appear before us, My Lord.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.570
I can't believe you actually found it.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.200
I hope you

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.250
will keep your promise.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.430
Tan'er and Pianpian...

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.570
Which one do you choose?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.920
Tan'er!

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.960
Before you left,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.830
you kept saying

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.720
you wanted to
restore Lu Pianpian's appearance

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.320
in exchange for her freedom.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.860
But now that you returned,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.160
you only think of your own sister.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.270
I beg you, My Lord.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.120
Please release Tan'er.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.030
My sister and I

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.960
are willing to collect
all mirror fragments for you.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.070
Tan'er!

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.190
Is she willing to listen to you?

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.920
Tan'er,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.960
I've voluntarily pledged allegiance
to the Immortal Lord.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.620
You must behave yourself too.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.240
Please, My Lord,

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.000
examine the mirror fragment

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.460
as proof of our sincerity.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.110
Tan'er,

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.750
hurry!

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.350
Xiao Yao,

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.900
help me take Tan'er

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.920
and Pianpian away.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.230
Dali!

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.510
How foolish.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.200
You think I couldn't see through

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.480
your suicide attack strategy?

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.110
Xiao Yao.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.480
Dali!

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.910
Die!

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.040
Dali.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.310
Xiao Yao.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.920
Why is it you?

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.720
Perhaps

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.060
from the moment I chose the Immortal Lord,

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.590
the ending was already decided.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.510
Xiao Yao.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.830
Am I beautiful?

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.400
You are the most beautiful.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.280
You're the most beautiful one.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.550
Go back...

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.680
and tell Luoluo

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.920
that

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.120
I'm cultivating

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.880
somewhere far away.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.400
Dali.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.790
Dali!

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.310
Xiao Yao,

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.180
you're the one who made her feel inferior

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.830
and crave attention.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.490
The one who truly killed her

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:45.600
is you.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.010
It's because you don't trust anyone.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.150
That's why
there's no one trustworthy around you.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.010
You do trust people,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.840
but the person you trust

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.600
won't wait for you anymore.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.270
Hong Ye,

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.110
come out.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.090
Thank you for your kindness, My Lord.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.080
How have you been feeling these days,
Demon King?

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.470
I'm grateful to you

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.770
for curing my Heart-Devouring Poison.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.520
I've been feeling refreshed these days.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.260
Looking back at my former obsession now,

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.350
it seems utterly absurd.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.100
Your poison is cured?

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.350
The Demon King found out

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.000
you eloped with a Feiyu Guard

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.370
and became depressed.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.950
He no longer wanted to endure
that Heart-Devouring pain.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.020
Thus, he begged me

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.820
to detoxify him.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.440
I won't keep making mistakes
for someone so selfish.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.560
The Immortal Lord has detoxified me
of the Heart-Devouring Poison

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.710
and planted the luan and phoenix for me.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.230
From now on, my heart is the luan.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.520
The Immortal Lord is the phoenix.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.570
Our hearts are connected.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.590
We'll share weal and woe.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.240
Hong Ye,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.400
do you have unspoken difficulties?

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.270
Is it her illusion tricking you?

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:33.960
Shut up!

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.340
Immortal Lord,

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.640
let her go.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.830
Don't let her disturb us.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.120
Do you really have no feelings for her?

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.360
Your heart is in pain.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.900
You still can't let her go.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.550
I tried to suppress
this Heart-Devouring Poison,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.550
but you still sensed it.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.300
Let her go.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.420
I will find
all the mirror fragments for you.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.990
What if I don't let her go?

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.240
Xiao Yao,

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.480
run!

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.390
I won't leave.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.160
Hurry!

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.750
This is madness.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.680
Xiao Yao

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.480
Xiao Yao,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.750
Hong Ye is reciting
the Heart-Burning Incantation.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.240
This spell concentrates all power
into the heart meridian.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.920
The heart meridian will rupture.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.400
Since the Luan-Phoenix Poison
creates a symbiotic link,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.550
the Dreamshard Immortal's heart

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.150
will also shatter into dust.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.720
Hong Ye, stop it now!

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.000
Xiao Yao.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.790
Hong Ye!

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.600
Leave now!

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.720
No!

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.290
Hong Ye!

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.640
You think this little pain can harm me?

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.560
The suffering I've endured

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.720
is countless times worse than this.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.240
Hong Ye!

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.750
Stop it now!

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.640
Xiao Yao!

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.790
Hurry!

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.550
Hong Ye!

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.790
Hong Ye!

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.410
In this Realm of Mist and Void,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.960
the only one who can control my fate

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.030
is myself.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.720
Dreamshard!

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.220
Why have you driven us to this point?

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.240
Xiao Yao,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.880
I just want to tell you

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.250
to stop fooling yourself.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.130
Hong Ye's sincerity toward you

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.240
doesn't mean that everyone

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.410
is sincere to you.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.010
Who's fooling themselves?

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.640
Is it me or you?

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.870
In flower sea, there's one bloom

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.090
that's never watered,

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.110
yet covered in morning dew.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.650
If I'm not mistaken,

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.480
that's the true heart you discarded
before becoming a spirit.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.790
I haven't watered you yet.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.850
But why do you already have dew on you?

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.520
Where did your dew come from?

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.150
Among the thousands of flowers
in the flower sea,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.580
why are you the most special one?

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.690
You must have been a crybaby
when you were human.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.090
The dew on the flower

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.920
must be your unresolved tears.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.270
You created all these trials

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.400
just to prove that

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.660
true feelings
still exist in this world.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.340
But there's someone
who has been waiting for you,

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.550
yet you chose to ignore him.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.030
Who?

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.480
Taotie.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.880
He waited for Jin Ge
for a thousand years,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.100
without complaint or regret.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.000
Jin Ge is gone.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.330
She went away a thousand years ago.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.790
Jin Ge never left.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.240
She just wrapped herself

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.960
in a hard shell.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.970
Now I've brought what you wanted.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.030
I've also proven
the true feelings you didn't believe in.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.350
You can take my life easily.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.510
But being able to die with the one I love,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.550
I have no regrets.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.580
I don't need anyone's sincerity.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.310
Taotie has one more message for Jin Ge.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.680
He said

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.310
his jianzi skills now

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.960
are even better than Jin Ge's were before.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.110
Jin Ge!

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.030
Your appearance has changed,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.640
but I still recognize you.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.270
Do you remember me?

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.350
Xiao Yao must have told you

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.570
that my jianzi skills
are better than yours were.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.780

Why is it like this now?

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.949
What on earth is going on?

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.630

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.360
How dare you!

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.560
Such slander will get your tongue cut out.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.670
Hong Ye.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.360
Hong Ye.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.150
Hong Ye, wake up.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.960
You're the Demon King.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.760
You'll be fine, won't you?

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.590
Hong Ye!

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.030
Hong Ye!

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.550
Don't scare me, Hong Ye.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.510
You're shaking me to death.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.590
Hong Ye!

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.320
I knew it.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.680
You wouldn't die so easily.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.970
I haven't taken you
to see scenic views

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.900
or explored the world yet.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.240
How could I leave so easily?

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.670
Yes.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.710
Xiao Yao.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.760
My duty is finished.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.790
Will you say goodbye to me?

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.180
Little Leaf.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:25.970
Little Leaf.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.110
Xiao Yao.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.090
Kiss me,

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.160
and I'll forget all the bad things.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.400
This one is

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.370
Unattainable Desire?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.070
Indeed.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.890
These two mirror fragments

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.600
should return to their rightful owner.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.930
A hundred years ago,

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.230
the former emperor gathered
all fragments of the Kunlun Mirror,

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:01.670
but before he could
find the celestial mountain,

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.270
the Demon King destroyed it.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.030
Now that the ancient Kunlun Mirror
has reappeared,

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.760
it should return to
the current emperor's hands.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.110
Do you know that the ancient Kunlun Mirror
from a hundred years ago

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.250
was obtained by your so-called
former emperor

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.160
through despicable means?

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.330
A hundred years have passed

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.760
and it's still the same.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.580
He's unable to disregard life and death,

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.030
all because of greed.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.320
How dare you!

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.630
-Stop!
-Xiao Yao, get out of the way!

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.000
-Xiao Yao!
-What are you doing?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.130
Assembling the ancient Kunlun Mirror

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.000
and eliminating the Demon King

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.400
are His Majesty's direct orders

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.130
and the duty of the Feiyu Guard.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.000
He sacrificed the lives of a hundred women

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.550
to gain immortality for himself.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.480
Do you think such a person

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.440
truly deserves your blind obedience?

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.760
I only follow orders.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.920
I cannot defy the imperial decree.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920
Imperial decree?

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.670
If it weren't for the imperial decree,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.480
why would Tan'er
have been driven to such desperation?

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.960
Now, you only care about imperial orders

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.290
and have lost
all sense of right and wrong.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.510
Tan'er,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.250
do you also think
what your brother is doing is right?

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.200
This mirror fragment

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:26.050
has nothing to do with you.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.000
And the one in your hand

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.660
wasn't obtained by you alone.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.360
If you really want to take it,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.030
either kill us both right now

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.400
or

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.630
wait until everyone has recovered

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:43.960
and you two can have

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.840
a fair contest.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.440
Fine.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.380
If that's the case,

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.080
these two mirror fragments

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.440
shall be in your keeping.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:09.050
When all fragments are gathered,

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.070
I will take them back.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.760
Hong Ye.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.590
For what happened
in the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.360
I owe you a favor.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.420
But between us,

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.030
there will eventually be
a battle to the death.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.800
Go back and focus on your cultivation.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.190
The Demon Slayer has returned!

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.320
The Demon Slayer has returned!

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.150
What's wrong?

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.510
Is he injured?

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.150
What happened to him?

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.960
I don't know.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:53.960
Is he alright?

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.520
Can we go home now?

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:56.070
Yes.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.260
The Dreamshard Immortal...

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.360
She has been killed.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.880
We knew you're brave

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.280
and would keep us safe.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.960
Throughout this perilous journey,

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.400
it was thanks to you, My Lord,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.670
that we could survive.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.150
Please, My Lord,

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.480
take us to reunite
with our families quickly.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.760
Yes, take us home.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.320
My Lord.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:18.990
Let's prepare to go home.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.880
Please take us back soon.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.340
-Okay.
-We can go home now.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.000
We can finally go home.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.260
We can finally return.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.700
My Lord, are you looking for Lu Pianpian?

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.840
She's with Zhirui and Pei.
