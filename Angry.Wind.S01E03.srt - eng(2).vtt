WEBVTT

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.400
Who said you could kiss me

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.400
Who are you

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.320
I am your husband

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.120
Husband

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.080
Husband

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.960
Zheng Nanfeng

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.680
You are awake

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.360
Zheng Nanfeng, why are you in my house

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.680
You drank too much last night

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.560
I brought you back

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.320
You take people home

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.560
and put them on the bed

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.480
Then I made you sleep on the sofa

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080
Be honest

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.720
Did you do anything over the line last night

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.160
Over the line

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.400
What counts as over the line

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.880
What else could it be

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.760
Of course, that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.720
Oh

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.480
That, well of course it is that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.480
Zheng Nanfeng, do you have a death wish

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120
I am your husband

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.960
Murdering your husband is a serious crime

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.400
What is wrong

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.720
Oh come on, just joking

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.600
Last night you held me and would not let me go

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.680
And we did not do anything else

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.000
Really, you are not lying to me

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.320
Am I the kind of man who takes advantage

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.960
I like you and I rely on my abilities to win you over

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.480
Crazy

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.000
Okay, cut it out

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.480
You drank so much and still feel awful

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.240
I bought breakfast

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.160
I know you cannot drink milk

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.920
Lactose intolerance

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.840
Soy milk it is

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.520
How do you know that

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.760
And I also know

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.240
You like to hang your pajamas in the bathroom

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.840
You get up at two every night for a sip of water

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.200
When you sleep, if you do not hold me

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.480
you sleep restlessly

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.280
How do you know me so well

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.360
I know even more

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.280
You are a bit hard to figure out

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.760
No worries, there will be plenty of time to guess

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.560
But I am quite worried Xie Jiachang will target you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.920
Guess I will have to put myself through it again

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.400
Hurry and help me get a room ready

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.440
I am moving in tonight

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.440
Zheng Nanfeng, you really do not see yourself as an outsider

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.160
Do not read too much into it

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.000
I am purely doing this to protect you

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.160
I do not need your protection

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.280
Out, I need to change

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.240
I can help

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.120
No need to go out

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.600
I can help

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.160
Get out

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.040
Hey

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.960
Hello

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.880
What, got it

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.680
I am coming right away

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.000
What is wrong

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.920
Something happened at the nightclub

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.680
Go downstairs and drive

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.600
I will change and come down

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.600
Sister Zhiyi, Nanfeng

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.680
You finally made it

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.320
What’s with you two?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.920
We just ran into each other at the door

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.080
What’s going on now?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.320
We came in together this morning

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.800
Found the office safe had been pried open

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.840
The design blueprints inside

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.120
All for the nightclub are gone

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.520
It was definitely Xie Jiachang

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.720
And our entire business model

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.040
They copied that too

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.760
If Xie Jiachang starts doing this

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.520
we lose our edge

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.520
Didn’t expect him to hit back so fast

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.760
No, I thought it was no big deal

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.600
You didn’t think I could, just with a business model,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.040
make his nightclub shut down, right?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.720
So what?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.160
What else can we revamp in this nightclub?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.400
The business model is the foundation

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.000
But updates are too slow and too easy to copy

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.760
Even if Xie Jiachang doesn’t copy it

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.800
someone else will

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.960
We should be at the forefront of the industry

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.480
What is this long-winded stuff?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.800
Just tell us what else we can do

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.040
A nightclub’s success

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.160
is a multi-dimensional business model

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.080
The key is whether the software has core competitiveness

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.320
For example, we have

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.200
the ability to stir up the guests’ emotions

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.440
with mind-blowing dances and songs

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.240
We have all of that

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.920
Yeah

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.040
Too old, too clichéd

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.400
I want something fresher

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.800
Where do we find those new things?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.720
Here

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.440
Where?

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.360
In three days, find a new group of dancers

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
Take these materials

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480
Go to the address above and find this person

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.880
Thanks, next

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.680
Come on, you, you

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.000
Hey, hey

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.000
What are you doing?

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.360
Hey man, are you hiring dancers here?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.000
Yes, we only hire female performers

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.600
I dance crazy good

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.400
I’m telling you

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.360
In Kaoshantun

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.120
I’m the dance king

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.920
Dance king or whatever

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.120
We don’t take male performers

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.600
Move along

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.760
Man, let me show you a bit

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.800
Miss, you step down

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.440
Hi, boss

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.360
Music

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.520
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.120
No, man,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.800
Your style doesn’t suit us

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.720
Next time, maybe

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.760
I’ve trained for a year

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.160
Let me do another one for you

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.360
This one works!

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.880
We… we don’t need it

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.800
I’ll… I’ll go then

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.280
One last time

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.120
Just once

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.720
Hold him back, hard

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.800
Dude, I can cross-dress

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.200
Go, go

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.640
No

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.200
Women’s clothes

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.880
No

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.680
Women’s clothes

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.720
Oh mom, what is this?

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.680
Don’t underestimate this guy

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.360
He might blow up in the future

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.360
Are you crazy or is he?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.760
Watch your mouth

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.160
He might be your future brother-in-law

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.840
Huh?

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.600
What do you mean?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.040
Zheng Nanfeng didn’t go back to the dorm that night

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.480
He came with Zhou Zhiyi the next day

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.280
You forgot

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.560
Uh?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.840
Do we have another one?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.000
Zheng Nanfeng

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.600
Hey, hey, hey

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.040
Xu Rumeng

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.440
You disappeared for months; I couldn't reach you

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.400
So you were ghosting me, huh?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.400
Xu Rumeng

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.640
The big star ten years from now

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.680
My

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680
ex-girlfriend

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.960
Aren't you in Hong Kong, China?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.120
How come you came back to the mainland?

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.760
You left me behind and just took off

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.440
You jerk

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520
Wait, no,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.040
Who are you to come here and cause a scene?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.320
I'm his girlfriend

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.240
ex-girlfriend

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.440
Zheng Nanfeng, you're something else

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.280
So you found someone to bully me, huh?

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.440
When did Zheng Nanfeng

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.920
get another girlfriend?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.600
I wondered why you ran off

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.280
Turns out you had another woman

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.680
I'm here today to get an explanation from you

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.200
Zheng Nanfeng, you're pretty fickle

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.360
You have a girlfriend yet you still fool around

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.280
Yeah, so what?

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:49.640
Stop

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.160
Xu Rumeng

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.080
Why did you go to the mainland?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.440
Weren't you there to shoot a film?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.960
Showbiz isn't that easy to make it in

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.120
If I go alone, I can only play bit parts

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.320
And my family doesn't support me doing this

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.200
So I want to go back to Haicheng first

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.400
Find a job and take it from there

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.000
Wait a second

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.120
I remember you studied dance, right?

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.640
Yeah, what's up?

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.040
That's great

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.440
You're the one

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.960
She's the one

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.000
With her dance skills, she'll definitely be up for it

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.560
Zheng Nanfeng

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.520
I think you want to get back with your ex

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.800
It's work time now

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.840
If you want romance, take it home

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200
Why are you jealous?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.040
Jealous my ass

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.120
You've only been a manager for a few days

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.840
Already abusing power for personal gain, huh?

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.200
Let me tell you

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.840
Based on what I know about her

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.120
She'll definitely be our nightclub's secret weapon

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.680
Her

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.800
Can she handle it?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.200
If she can't

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.680
Then nobody can

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.200
Xu Rumeng is really good-looking

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.640
Her dancing is gorgeous too

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.840
This move pulled in so much buzz

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.800
She will have bigger stages in the future

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.800
Your little girlfriend is pretty, huh?

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.520
If you like her, go get her back

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.600
Chase her for what?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.080
I already have a wife

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.880
You have a wife?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.680
You

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.680
Zheng Nanfeng

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.080
You never stop, do you?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.880
How was it?

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.600
It was insane

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.680
Look, you got the whole place hyped

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.320
I have studied dance for years

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.040
Never thought dance could be choreographed like this

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.520
And clothes can be worn like this too

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.040
And I have never even heard this music

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.640
Where did you learn all this?

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.120
Well, that I cannot tell you

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.360
Trade secret

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.160
Zheng Nanfeng

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.360
I feel you are different from before

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.400
I can't put the current you into words

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.200
Ah

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.440
Oh right, I forgot to tell you

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.160
I checked out of the hotel

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.360
Does your nightclub have somewhere to stay?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.800
There is no space in the dorm

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.920
Why not stay at my place?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.360
You are now the star of our club

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.840
It is not safe to live alone

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.280
I have to protect you well

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.360
Right?

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.400
Yes, yes, yes

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.920
Our rivals are really nasty

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.320
We need to protect you well

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.320
From now on the three of us will live together

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.960
We can also look out for each other

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.200
I only let Xu Rumeng go to my place

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.480
What does that have to do with you?

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.200
Well, you are women after all

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.080
If anything happens

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.800
We men have to step up

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.960
Moving is a bit of a hassle

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.240
No need to be polite with me

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.680
I will move over today

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.360
Great, I was just going to tell you

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.880
I came because I want to live with you

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.120
That is not what I meant

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.440
Stop, stop, stop

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.440
Their dance is mind-blowing

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680
Mind-blowing, do you get it?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.560
What on earth are you dancing?

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.280
Manager, this is too hard

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.160
Yeah, we have never seen it before

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.280
Besides, your recording is no good

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.120
It is choppy and not clear to see

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.040
You guys practice first

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.480
I will think of a way

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.040
Not only was the Rip-off exposed

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.000
Now we cannot even copy them, right?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.360
Boss, their update speed is too fast

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.320
We still have not mastered this business model

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.160
They have already moved on to new dances

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.480
And we had never even seen that stuff before

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.080
Our people really cannot keep up

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.720
We cannot solve the problem

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.680
Then we deal with the people

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.160
Zheng Nanfeng

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.200
Hey

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.200
I'm not Zheng Nanfeng

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.320
He's Zheng Nanfeng

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.600
Sit down

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.760
You scumbag

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.280
I told you to stay away from my sister

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.280
And you still let her dance in a place like this

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.760
Your sister

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.840
Youyou

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.240
Sis

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.120
Youyou, why are you here?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.280
Uncle told me to come

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.880
He said he's not mad at you anymore

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.640
He wants you to go back to Hong Kong,China?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.040
Let's talk outside

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.760
Let's go

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.920
Not you two

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.000
She hit me

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.880
Please enjoy

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.720
Thanks

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:54.760
Sis

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440
A scumbag is always a scumbag

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.600
They'll never change

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.520
Don't let him fool you

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:01.960
Sis

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.080
He's become really impressive now

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.600
He composed the music and choreographed the dance for me

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.840
I haven't seen that even overseas

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.920
I heard he's cozying up to the boss's wife

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.680
Watch out, he might be two-timing

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.440
I know that Zhou Zhiyi

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.640
has a thing for him

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.560
But it doesn't matter

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.160
Only I can be with him

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.520
Fine, this trip was for nothing

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.200
Uncle also promised me

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.920
if I persuade you to go back

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.560
he'll buy me a sports car

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.400
Xu Youyou, you little brat

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.480
You're conning my dad again

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.600
Don't be harsh with me

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.440
If you shout at me, I'll go tell your dad

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.160
his daughter fell for a good-for-nothing punk

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.280
and she's even ditching her family

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.400
You...

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.280
I told you, Zheng Nanfeng

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.760
he's not a punk

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.720
He, he used to be a bit cynical

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.000
but now he's completely changed

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.680
You'll know once you meet him

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.720
He's become mature and steady

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.560
and charismatic

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.960
Mature, steady, and charismatic

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.520
Sis

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.240
I think you're really bewitched

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.200
See that?

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.680
The table by the street

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.920
Make it quick later

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.960
Don't worry, Brother Jie

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.200
That damn girl

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.600
Ran off without waiting for me

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.120
I miss you

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.040
Whenever dusk arrives

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.920
the evening breeze rises

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.760
I miss you

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.760
Life's riddle

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.880
Try not to see it clearly

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.280
Close your eyes

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.480
Do not respond

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.480
The evening breeze blows and blows

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.160
go with the wind

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.600
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.760
Don't cry in secret

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.600
The evening breeze blows and blows

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.280
go with the wind

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.440
As night falls and stars

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.440
gently drift to sleep

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.880
Feel the evening breeze
