=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.300
=Episode 8=
(No Honor Among Bandits)

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:19.120
If you came to investigate this case,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.080
you're looking for the wrong man.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.639
The one who paid for a fake head

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.800
was Zhao Chengxi.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.680
Zhao Chengxi.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.800
He's who you should be after.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:30.319
Too bad

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:32.400
you won't live to see another day.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.680
Die!

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.559
(In the third month)

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:28.600
(of the fifth year of Chongning,)

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.110
(Huang Baocheng starved
his father Huang Agen to death,)

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.679
(severed his head,)

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.399
(branded it with a false mark,
and buried it at Qili Slope.)

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:37.440
(He acted under orders)

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.479
(from a man named Zhao Chengxi,)

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.240
(who paid him in silver)

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:43.759
(to do it.)

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.960
He won't wake up
for another six to ten hours.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.119
Keep the confession with you.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.800
Why did you rush out?

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.039
You saw me signal you to stop.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.660
Were you trying to get yourself killed?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.600
I saw it.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.440
But I don't take orders from you.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.119
Indeed.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.570
You're the last person
who needs to listen to me.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.440
You prefer
County Magistrate Jiang over me.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.679
You only listen to him.

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.990
Well, now look at us.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.790
We're stuck at the foot of the mountain.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.410
We'll have to wait for the rain to stop
before we can go back up.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.320
(You and her)

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.960
(were poisoned.)

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.199
(You risked your life
to feed her the antidote,)

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.440
(yet she didn't appreciate it at all.)

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.559
Why did you give me the antidote?

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.759
You deliberately used yourself as bait

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.730
to lure Huang Baocheng out and trick him
into confessing, didn't you?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.559
This is my case.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.240
You didn't have to go that far.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.440
You have a blessed life.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.199
You're the disciple of the chancellor.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.440
You have a brilliant future ahead.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.839
Yet you risked your life for this case.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.320
Don't tell me

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.640
you've taken a liking to me.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.990
I favor well-bred ladies

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:28.359
from respectable families,

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:31.480
as well as gentle, soft-spoken women.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:34.720
However, I've no interest
in temperamental lunatics.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.119
Investigating cases
and eradicating criminals

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.600
are my duties.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.359
Don't overthink it

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.320
and make trouble for yourself.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.279
And one more thing…

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.160
What are you doing?

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.959
I'm testing whether you meant

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.399
what you just said.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.200
And what's the verdict?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.440
Your breathing's steady.
Your heartbeat's normal.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.600
You were telling the truth.

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:34.839
Good.

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:41.519
Where'd you learn such a lowly trick?

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.279
Don't go trying it on anyone else.

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:46.799
You might just…

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:53.440
I'm fine.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:54.559
Tomorrow, I'll…

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.040

Within a quarter of an hour,
it'll stir certain thoughts and desires,

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.799

The Blended Harmony incense is meant

Is there anything you want to do?

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.160
All

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.839
you want to do is comb my hair?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.190
It looks like a pile of straw.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.760
Hurts my eyes just looking at it.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.120
Anyone can tell
you don't bother taking care of it.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.640
You're nothing like the other ladies.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.200
You should've been like them.

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:44.440
We found them!

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.280
They're here!

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.080
Get the carriage up here!

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.640
Master Lu's badly injured!

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:05.237
(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.359
Once there were two brothers,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.960
both greedy for money and power.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.400
The elder brother,
for the sake of wealth,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.719
could even starve
his own father to death.

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:22.200
What he didn't know was that

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.440
his younger brother,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.880
who appeared indecisive and harmless,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.119
had an even more vicious heart.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.679
Their father hadn't died of starvation.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.880
He was poisoned by the younger brother.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:34.320
That's why his face turned

00:09:34.599 --> 00:09:37.080
that terrifying shade of purple
when he died.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.400
Years later,

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:42.760
someone in the stronghold
was poisoned the same way.

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.799
When the elder brother saw it,
he came up with a plan

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:48.679
and chopped off those men's heads.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.280
The younger brother saw this
and came up with a plan of his own.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.679
He played the madman

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.960
and set up
the Zhong Kui tale of devouring men,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.679
all so he could later

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.960
frame his brother for the killings.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.880
Once that happened,
the entire stronghold

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.479
would fall
into the younger brother's hands.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:12.239
Then, the authorities arrived.

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:14.520
He planned everything with great care.

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.799
Meticulously,

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:19.479
he pinned the crimes

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:22.239
and fake evidence on his brother.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.559
He had gone mad, after all.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.039
At worst, he'd be an accomplice.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.880
Isn't that right, Huang Baotian?

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.719
Huang Baotian.

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:38.559
You set me up!

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.080
(It was the eighth year of Zhenghe.)

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:41.390
(The 29th day of the 5th month.)

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.159
(It was drizzling.)

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.479
(No sun in sight,)

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.559
(yet life bloomed silently.)

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.162
(Nine days until
the seventh day of the sixth month)

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.559
(To die by your greed)

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.599
(is the ending you deserved.)

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.880
I knew you'd go looking
for those brothers.

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:02.000
Watching them go through questioning

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.280
so numb and painless

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
didn't sit right with me.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.039
I only told a few truths.

00:11:07.359 --> 00:11:08.400
I didn't kill anyone.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.440
That's hardly a crime.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.039
If I ever killed someone,

00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:15.840
would you take me in?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.000
Where are you going?

00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:25.320
To find Master Jiang

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.760
and ask him
to help me look into Zhao Chengxi.

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.020
Sir, a hatred that cuts to the bone

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.430
is something you've probably
never experienced in your life.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.760
You wouldn't understand
why I'd risk everything

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.080
just to fight for the truth.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.159
I see you've disregarded
all propriety with me.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.039
You don't trust me,
and you've no interest

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.719
in a madwoman like me.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.840
What do I have to fear?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.159
Does your maid

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.359
not know about your condition?

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.210
Why don't you have her
perform the acupuncture for you?

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.200
No one knows about it except you.

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:36.880
Brother…
