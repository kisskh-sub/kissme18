WEBVTT

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.840
We can't avoid Xie Jiachang fast enough

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.280
Why did you send him an invitation

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.040
Even if we don’t invite him

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.160
He’ll come on his own

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.120
Why not take the initiative

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.840
Today is the opening night

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.040
What if he causes trouble

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.200
He got burned last time

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.920
He definitely won’t let it go this time

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.520
Who knows best what Xie Jiachang is thinking

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.640
Is probably me

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.200
I have a plan

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.080
Trust me

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.120
Zhou Zhiyi, the drinks delivery is here

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.720
Is that the batch from Master Qin’s distillery

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.960
Yes, what’s wrong

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.440
Come here, I’ll assign you something

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.960
Why go to all that trouble

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960
Even if I explain, you won’t get it

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.880
Just do it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.960
Okay

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.920
Why should I take orders from you

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.240
Zheng Nanfeng is now the manager of the New Literati Club

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.720
What he says is what I say. Go

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.720
Not me

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.720
Out of respect for Zhou Zhiyi

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.400
I...

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.600
Hey, hey, hey

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.400
Wife, do you know what I’m going to do

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.200
I don’t know

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.240
Then why do you trust me so much

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.960
I already do

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.760
What else can I do

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.000
At worst, I’ll just sell you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.720
Who are you calling wife

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.560
Today I’ll surely give Xie Jiachang a welcome gift

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.960
Boss

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.360
Zhou Zhiyi’s side is making big moves today

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920
They even made admission free

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.240
All free

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.400
Just a gimmick

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.520
Free for how many days

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.920
No time limit, always free

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.520
Always free

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.920
That’s pretty novel

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.360
Are they turning the ballroom into charity

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.320
I told you we were too heavy-handed back then

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.320
Boss

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.320
This is an invitation from New Fantasy Ballroom

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.440
They actually sent us an invitation

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.200
Boss, beware of a trap

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.520
Who cares what kind of banquet it is

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.560
A storm is brewing

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.600
I’ve been wanting an excuse to go

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.960
He brought it to our door

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.360
Tonight I’m going to have a good time

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.720
Everyone, everyone

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.960
Tonight

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.400
It's the reopening day of our New Literati Club

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.960
To thank all our new and old patrons for coming

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.200
We specially prepared the hottest dance tracks

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.240
And the best drinks

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.920
And most, most, most, most importantly,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.040
As long as you bring our coupons and come

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.800
There's no ticket needed at our club

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.840
We hope you spread this news quickly

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.600
Welcome, welcome, please come inside

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.840
Welcome, thank you

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.240
Thank you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.760
Welcome to New Literati Club

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.400
No tickets needed

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.360
Zheng Nanfeng must be crazy

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.360
I really don't know, Sister Zhiyi,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720
why you handed the club to him to run

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.640
Didn't he say

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.000
he'd shut Xie Jiachang's ballroom in one month?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.760
Though I don't get his approach

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.040
He looks pretty confident to me

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.560
He must have his reasons

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.920
I think we won't last a few days before we fold

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.920
Zheng Nanfeng

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.400
I've put all my assets on the line for you

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.960
Half the club's revenue comes from tickets

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.040
If it's all free, can we hold up?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.600
You need a product manager mindset

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.720
Free is the most expensive

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.640
Hmph

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.720
A club should use traffic to drive sales

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.160
Free is the most expensive

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.760
Looks like this kid really got beaten badly

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.360
No, we need to find him a good doctor

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520
Get his head checked

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.840
Welcome, welcome to New Literati Club

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Welcome to New Literati Club

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.600
Welcome to New Literati Club

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.440
Master Qin is here

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.000
Nanfeng,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.560
I heard from the mall folks downstairs

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.160
you placed a big order with me

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.120
You really know how to get things done

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.560
Master Qin, you're too kind

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.600
Master Qin

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.520
Then tonight you must have a few extra drinks

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.800
Of course

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.080
Let's go

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.320
Zhiyi, this kid is a decent guy

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.640
And he handles things well

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.800
Yadong has been gone for quite a few years

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.920
You should think about your own situation

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.840
Master Qin, what are you saying?

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.000
I'm fine on my own

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.960
Relax, Master Qin, I'll definitely take good care of her

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.240
Get lost

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.520
Hahaha

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.920
If you ask me,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.120
the way you two flirt and bicker,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.520
really looks like a couple

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.040
Please stop joking about me

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.920
Let me help you inside

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.440
No need, no need

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.240
You mind your work

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.960
Take good care of Master Qin; inside, please

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.600
Give him a proper welcome

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.600
Welcome to New Literati Club

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.120
Everyone, relax

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.360
Oh!

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.200
What are you doing?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.440
Putting in so much money

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.960
And tickets are free, too

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.600
President Zhou, careful not to get conned by this kid

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.720
Mind your own business

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.520
Just mind your own business

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.520
President Xie

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.800
We specially invited you today

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.800
to clear up the misunderstanding from the other day

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.240
Hope you have fun tonight

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.560
Since it's a misunderstanding,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.520
it's not so easy to resolve

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.160
I'm afraid if it's resolved, some people won't be happy

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.520
Then let's wait and see

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.240
Aming

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.800
Let them in

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.920
Go in

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.720
No, where are you going?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.120
Welcome to New Literati Club

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.160
Impossible

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.400
Where did they find this designer?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.440
I've never seen this kind of design in my life

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.840
Boss, I haven't seen it either

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.920
And they don't even charge for tickets

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.760
What's the use of a crowd?

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.200
Most of a ballroom's revenue is tickets

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.720
People who came in for a bargain won't even buy drinks

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.960
How the hell can he make any money?

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.920
He'll lose his shirt

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.760
Master Qin

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.840
Whatever you want to drink tonight is on me

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.600
Your ballroom opens today

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.040
I’ve got to show my support

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.160
I’ll top up 5,000 first

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.200
Master Qin guarantees you’ll have fun tonight

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.120
Come on

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.920
Boss

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.320
Thanks V12 Master Qin for 1288 Grand Flying Dragon set

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.640
Wish Master Qin a great time

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.560
Drink to your heart’s content

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.560
Boss

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.560
W-what booze is this

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.840
Costs more than flower wine

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.440
Why panic

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.240
Calm down

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.800
Can I not afford even one bottle

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.400
You can afford it

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.440
Then that’s settled

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.760
Come, open a bottle for Master Qin

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.280
Okay, okay, okay

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.600
Wish Master Qin drinks well and has fun tonight

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.920
Give me another set

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.320
Thanks Master Qin for another 1288

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.720
Now tops the New Literati Club spending list

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.800
Okay

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.000
Owner, get me a set too

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.720
Boss, you get a set too

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.520
Make it pricier than his

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.120
Got it, right away

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.040
Enjoy your drink

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.840
I’ll go over first

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080
Come, come, here

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200
Enjoy your drink, Boss

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.520
Hey, Boss

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.720
Hey, Boss

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.800
Don’t get carried away, no, no, no

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.320
Don’t forget why we came here

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.920
We’ll talk business later

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.440
That punk is scheming against me

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.960
So many people ordered Grand Flying Dragon

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.360
If I don’t order one, do I have any face

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.920
Got it, got it, Boss

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.520
Give me a Grand Flying Dragon set

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.960
Make it two sets

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.800
Here, Boss

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.160
A toast to you, Boss

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
You’re pretty sharp, kid

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.760
What did you say

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.240
I said tonight’s revenue is over 50,000

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.920
That’s more than ten times the usual

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.440
All small-time

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.720
There’s even bigger coming

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.160
Where did you learn all this

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.120
Give me a little reward

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.920
Let me tell you

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.160
Zheng Nanfeng, you have a death wish, huh

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.360
Ah

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.320
What’s wrong with him, what is it

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.480
Someone died from drinking

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.120
Quick, see what’s wrong

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.600
Someone died from drinking

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.400
This booze is bad, someone died from it

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.200
Someone, come quick

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.520
My buddy only had two drinks

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.920
Suddenly this happened, the booze is bad

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.560
This booze is bad

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.800
My buddy only had two drinks

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.760
Then suddenly this happened

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.920
Huh

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.680
Boss, the taste is off

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.720
Taste is off, it’s fake

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.760
Xie Jiachang, you making trouble, huh

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.840
With a store this big, would I sell you fake booze

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.000
A Jie, you’re being really rude

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.400
Look how you scared the lady

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.400
Sorry

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.640
Mr. Zhou, I didn’t mean anything

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.400
This booze really has a weird taste

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.520
A Jie

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.000
You’re falsely accusing us

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.240
Does Mr. Zhou sell fake booze

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.240
Bro

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.920
I drink this booze every day

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.320
I’m sure this booze is fake

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.640
And they’re charging so much for it

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.560
It’s clearly ripping people off

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.720
Is this booze really bad

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.160
Look, they’re selling fake booze

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.720
See, it’s so expensive

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.640
So shady

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.640
Xie Jiachang

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.520
Your low-down tricks are way too crude

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.200
I just stocked this booze this morning

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.800
The bottles are right here on display

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.760
Taste it yourself

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.120
Xie Jiachang

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.440
Is it fake liquor?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.640
Zhiyi's ballroom opened today

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.840
Can't you stop making trouble?

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.120
I know Zhou's character

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.520
Today I, Master Qin, give my guarantee

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.320
She would never sell fake liquor

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.440
Master Qin

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.240
Zhiyi's character

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.440
I believe it two hundred percent

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.720
But her crew

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.840
Especially that kid, Zheng Nanfeng

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.400
Whether he's clean is hard to say

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.840
But this liquor,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.360
is definitely a problem

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.040
Master Qin doesn't believe

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.960
Have a sip

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.800
Fine, pour me a glass, I'll try

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.960
Master Qin

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.560
Since you say this liquor has a problem,

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.520
Then I'll down it

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.760
See if it poisons me to death

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.840
Wait

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.840
Let me see

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.520
It's fake, no need to look

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.640
Zheng Nanfeng, are you insane?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.160
Good, so quick to confess

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.960
This kid has some backbone

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.560
I haven't finished talking yet

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.320
Alright, go on

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.240
The liquor is indeed fake

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.040
But this isn't liquor from our ballroom

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.520
In your ballroom,

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.000
The liquor ordered isn't yours,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.200
Is it mine then?

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.200
Is that so?

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720
A Ming

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.360
Bare words aren't proof

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.560
What arrived today,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560
all the liquor,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.480
labels and codes are all recorded

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.240
I looked at your bottle,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.720
it's not on the list

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.520
So this is liquor you brought

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Nonsense

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.600
This liquor was clearly just ordered

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.800
You're the one with no proof

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.200
You're saying I'm selling fake liquor, right?

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.920
Master Qin, I didn't mean you

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.520
I mean this kid

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.360
We ordered today's goods from Master Qin

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.440
You say this liquor isn't something you brought

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.120
Then it came from Master Qin's store

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.320
You mean Master Qin sells fake liquor?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360
Xie Jiachang

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.400
Are you trying to frame the New Literati Club,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.960
or frame my store?

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.800
Master Qin, I wouldn't dare accuse you

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.440
Misunderstanding

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.960
Misunderstanding

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.040
I think it's a misunderstanding

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.160
Tell it to the police

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.200
Zhiyi, call the police

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.120
A Ming

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.720
Master Qin, no need to blow it up, right?

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.720
Ah, no no no

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.120
Bro, my taste buds must've been off just now

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.040
I'll check, I... I'll check again

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.120
You're destroying evidence

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.920
Zheng Nanfeng

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.000
Just you wait

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.320
Hey, hey, hey

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.840
Extorting, huh? Extorting

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.240
Hey

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.520
Your boss has left, and you're still pretending

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.400
You caught me

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.400
Wow, I'm so smart!

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.800
Boss, wait for me!

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.520
Sorry to kill the mood, everyone

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.560
Everyone, keep playing, keep drinking

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.600
One bottle for each table

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.160
Cue the music

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.320
I have never been this exhilarated

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.400
Zheng Nanfeng, you're something else

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.120
You set all of this up, didn't you?

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240
It's our opening day, after all

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.200
Xie Jiachang will definitely come make trouble

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.840
So what we do is lure him into the trap

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.720
Nanfeng

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.960
You sent invites and kept the codes recorded

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.440
And you even pulled Master Qin in

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.120
This combo of moves you pulled...

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.920
I'm impressed

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920
I'm thoroughly convinced

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.240
I told you bringing Xie Jiachang would cause trouble

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.000
Even if you fix it, what can you do to him?

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.120
This is just the first step

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.360
Didn't I tell you?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.600
One month

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.280
I'll make him go out of business

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.640
Come on

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.000
For our opening today,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.720
A toast to beating Xie Jiachang!

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.920
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.000
Ah!

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520
Another glass

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.920
Ah!

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.920
Ah!

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.720
Okay

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.600
You can really hold your liquor

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.320
Feels great

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.440
Another glass

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.920
I'm happy today

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.720
Sister Zhiyi, another glass

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.920
Come on

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.720
I'll down it

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.960
Hey

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.000
Zheng Nanfeng, you're incredible

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.800
I...

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:02.760
Don't move

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.440
I feel like it's all in your plan

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.120
Let's have another drink

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.960
I really can't drink anymore

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.640
Rest well

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.600
I miss you

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.520
Whenever dusk falls

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.400
The evening breeze starts to blow

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.240
I miss you

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.240
Life's riddle

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.360
Try not to see it clearly

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.760
Close your eyes

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.960
Don't respond

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.960
The evening wind blows and blows

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.640
Go with the wind

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.080
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.240
Don't cry in secret

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.080
The evening wind blows and blows

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.760
Go with the wind

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.920
As night falls with the stars,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.920
Drift gently to sleep

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.360
Feel the evening breeze
