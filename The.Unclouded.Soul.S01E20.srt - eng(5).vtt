[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.660
[Episode 20]

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.600
After extensive inquiries,
the Feiyu Guards

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.640
have obtained the spring water
from Mount Tianyu.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.509
His Majesty is currently taking it
to recuperate.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.490
He has no time to care about your excuses.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800
The Kunlun Mirror is not yet complete.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.670
How could you have obtained
the Yuli Spring water?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.480
You dare to present fake spring water
as a tribute?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.820
Ji Yan,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.650
you are deceiving His Majesty!

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.310
Deceiving me?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.000
It seems to me the one deceiving me
is you, Bingzhu.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.800
Your Majesty!

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.850
Do you recognize this person?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.560
Of course we do.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:23.910
Your Majesty,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.240
the one who harmed us

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.440
is this man, Bingzhu.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.840
On the celestial mountain,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.650
we served the immortals
with all our hearts,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.579
and only then did they
grant us the Yuli Spring water.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.800
But to our surprise, he actually planned
to keep it for himself

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.280
and even tried to silence us.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.240
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.710
We escaped through countless hardships,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.030
all to see Your Majesty

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.290
and seek justice for our fallen sisters.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.320
Your Majesty,

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.630
they are clearly framing me!

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.560
I beg Your Majesty
to see through this deceit!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.890
For thousands of years,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.680
our ancestors endured countless hardships,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.520
and yet the first to drink
the Yuli Spring water

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.870
turns out to be you rat.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.000
At 3 quarters past noon tomorrow,
outside the Meridian Gate,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.590
Bingzhu will be executed.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.210
At that time,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.800
I'll bring all court officials to witness

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.750
just how effective
the Yuli Spring truly is.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.760
Hong Ye, look at this!

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.540
Miss, you have excellent taste.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.920
You're already so beautiful, Miss,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.360
and with my lantern,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.590
you'd truly be one of a kind.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.130
Well, I'm just looking.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.070
How much silver for this lantern, Boss?

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.160
Six coins.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.430
Sir.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.070
It's the Lantern Festival today.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.430
Now that you're out with your sweetheart,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.230
be generous with your spending.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.160
We don't want it.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.890
Hong Ye, let's look elsewhere.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.850
Please don't go!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.490
Wish-Fulfilling Rings!

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.830
If you land a ring,
get the prize for free!

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.360
If you miss, it's one tael of silver
for 10 rings.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.830
First come, first served!

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.160
It's all about luck!

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.240
You two.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.310
Want to try it out?

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.640
It's wish-fulfilling.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.750
Give me 5 rings.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.409
Sure thing!

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.560
Xiao Yao,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.320
we don't have any money on us.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.880
Don't worry. We're here to make money.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.400
Come on, you go first.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.940
Which one?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.340
Whichever you like.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.470
Let's watch them play first.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.630
He landed it!

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.159
He landed it!

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.950
He won!

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.720
You're so good!

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.510
Try again.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.320
-Sir, you're really lucky.
-Again. Again.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.210
He landed another one!

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.600
Go for the silver ingot.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.180
You won!

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.310
Great!

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.900
How can you call that a win?

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.880
Why isn't that a win?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.950
Yeah, why doesn't it count?

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.070
For the game of ring toss,

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.159
you have to land the ring in the center
to win.

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.510
But you didn't mention

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.840
this rule earlier.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.800
Boss, you can't cheat like this.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.830
Miss,

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.350
that's quite offensive.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.120
How can you call this cheating?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.870
I did say

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.920
I won't charge a penny
if you land the ring.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.460
But shouldn't you follow some basic rules?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.190
If everyone were like you, sir,

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.190
casually throwing rings

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.560
and counting near misses as wins,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.000
wouldn't I become

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.920
some fool who loses all his money?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.580
Fine, fine.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.350
We'll follow your rules.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.360
He landed it!

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.310
This must count now, right?

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.770
-That's right.
-Exactly.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.120
What do you have to say now?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.560
Exactly.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.630
This must count now, right?

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.290
Indeed.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.850
Still doesn't count.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.480
Why doesn't it count?

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.270
It clearly landed according to your rules.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.750
You were the one throwing rings before,

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.240
and now, suddenly this lady
is throwing them.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.640
What's the logic in that?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.870
So what?

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.200
We're a family.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.420
Just because you claim you're a family,
that makes it so?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.240
What if these two say they're a family

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.050
and want to play as one team,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.630
and those 5 also want to form a team?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.940
How am I supposed to run my business then?

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.880
Alright, fine.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.480
Today, I'll see it to the very end.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.610
Give me 5 more rings.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.140
Come on.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.820
Come on,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.120
give us 5 more rings.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.600
Sure,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.210
but pay for these 10 rings first.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.190
Why?

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.890
We'll pay for it altogether
after this round.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.210
Seems like you two

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.710
don't have any money.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.600
I could tell from the start.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.510
Since you've got no money,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.160
-I'll stop him. You go first.
-you wanted to use

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.310
some underhanded tricks...

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:09.800
No need.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.270
To scam me out of my money.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.840
Everyone here,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.180
you're all witnesses.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.510
I'm just trying to
run an honest business here.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.520
I've seen many people like this before.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.630
I can spot people like them

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.160
at a glance.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.680
In a moment, just do

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.080
whatever I tell you to do.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.310
Let me tell you,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.240
you're not leaving today.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.700
Either pay up properly,

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.400
or

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.880
hand over all those

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.429
tricks and gadgets you're hiding.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.390
Otherwise,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.580
don't blame me for getting rough.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.960
Everyone, look!

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.150
This man is making dirty money

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.440
and falsely accusing innocent people!

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.240
Is there no justice anymore?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.909
Exactly.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.000
-I'll let you know...
-Fall!

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.130
What justice means!

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.640
Honey.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.840
Honey!

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.480
Honey, what's wrong?

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.000
Stop pretending.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.320
How could you hit him?

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.630
This is extortion!

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.840
I didn't touch him at all!

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.720
I... You all saw it!

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.790
I truly didn't touch him!

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.960
You were already sick...

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.720
He fell down by himself!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.750
Close your eyes.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.630
You all saw it!

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.320
What am I supposed to do from here on out?

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.740
-I didn't touch him at all!
-What's going on here?

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.390
What happened?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.240
I didn't touch him.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.170
What's going on?

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.980
Officer!

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.010
It's him!

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.440
He's running a dishonest business!

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.390
He set us up

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.510
and punched my husband.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.440
My husband was already ill.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.270
Now

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.550
he's not going to survive.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.440
What should I do after he's gone?

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.840
Please seek justice for me, Officer!

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.120
It's not like that, Your Honor!

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.960
D-Don't listen to
this wicked woman's lies!

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.150
I didn't touch him at all!

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.390
I might have bumped him slightly
with my elbow,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.630

This one makes your skin look fair.

I'll take this one, Boss.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.370

Where have you been?

I didn't see you when I came out
after I finished eating.

I was so worried.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.750
I looked everywhere for you.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.750

Did you steal this?

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.630
I earned it.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.840
I didn't expect

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.480
you to use your looks to earn money,
My Lord.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.710
How is that "using my looks"?

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.740
In the martial world,
everyone relies on their own skills.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.140
That was your own saying.

Yes.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.150
You can make a wish with a sky lantern.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.510
When it reaches a certain height,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.630
you say your wish out loud,

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.830

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.590
fighting at dusk but making up by dawn.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.750
By morning, they'll definitely be fine,

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.200
right?

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.350
That's right.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.750
So, do you want it or not?

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.960
Yes, we'll take it.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.110
Great. Come on then.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.310
Alright, excellent.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.410
Come along.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.840
It's not like we haven't
shared a room before.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.810
You take the bed,

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.360
and I'll sleep on the floor.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.960
You take the bed.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.260
I'll meditate.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.550
You're a mortal now.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.340
Staying up late isn't good for
your health.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.340
Alright, come on.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.240
I'm still a bit hungry.
I didn't have my fill earlier.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240
I'll go have some late-night snacks

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.240
and be right back.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.860
I'll bring you something tasty
if I find any.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.720
I hope by the time I get back,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.320
he'll be asleep.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.370
But how could he possibly sleep
while I'm out alone?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.040
Forget it.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.310
I'll take this one. And this one.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.940
Two of these, please.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.870
-Alright.
-Today, we captured a boar demon

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.070
and are delivering it
to the magistrate's office

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.930
to eliminate this evil creature.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.830
This evil demon
has harmed countless people.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.000
At daybreak tomorrow,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.350
it'll be skinned alive
and have its tendons pulled,

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.880
its flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.530
Flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.160
Flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.310
This evil demon has harmed
countless people.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.680
At daybreak tomorrow,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.240
it'll be skinned alive
and have its tendons pulled,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.770
its flesh cut and bones stripped,
then braised and deep-fried.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.550
Flesh cut and bones stripped...

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.000
Luoluo!

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.660
Then braised and deep-fried.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.110
Great News on the Lantern Festival:

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.540
Today, we captured

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.680
a boar demon...

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.590
Bro.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.060
Don't eat too much.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.720
We'll slaughter the pig tomorrow,
remember?

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.160
Right.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.270
I should save some room.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.200
We've got a whole day of
pig feast coming up tomorrow.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.550
What's wrong?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.640
Bro, what is that?

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.790
You've had too much to drink, haven't you?

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.780
Those who have innocent blood
on their hands,

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.690
vengeful spirits have come to
claim your lives!

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.250
You've harmed too many innocent lives.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.920
Follow me to the underworld today

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.520
to pay for your bloody debts!

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.500
Xiao Yao's method really works.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.380
I've come to save you.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.580
Come with me quickly.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.260
Are you hurt?

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.560
Got you!

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.740
You stupid pig, you fell for it!

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.470
The Feiyu Guards' method really works.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.630
Another pig.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.820
Birds of a feather
really do flock together.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.460
Let's see what kind of creature
comes next.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.920
Come on, grunt for us.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.340
One, two, three, four.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.440
This is the perfect chance

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.030
to see if my skills

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:52.430
have improved recently.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.810
Another demon is here.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.350
Here comes another one.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.120
I'm your demon nightmare!

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.810
Xiao Yao!

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.480
Xiao Yao!

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.160
Xiao Yao!

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.220
Let's go. Let's go.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.840
Let's get out of here first.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.980
Tonight's haul is good.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.320
This is already the second one.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.070
If we're really going to be braised,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.160
just leave me behind.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.270
That's not for you to decide.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.940
Move aside.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.190
Mere parlor tricks.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.050
Attack!

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.130
Run! Come on, run for your life!

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.480
Cover your mouths and noses!

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.140
A great demon might be coming!

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.840
My Lord!

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.210
Our Demon King has come to save us!

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.060
Since you know who I am,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.800
there's no need to resist further.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.670
Today is the Lantern Festival.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.590
I don't wish to start a massacre.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.660
Let's go.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.030
Your power has really been restored?

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.910
Fire! Fire!

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.660
-Fire!
-Come on, run!

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.070
Fire!

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.830
It's lamp oil.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.200
That one just now
wasn't the Demon King at all.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.800
After him!

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.880
-Don't let him escape!
-This way!

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.550
After him!

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.630
Hurry! Keep up! This way!

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.380
After them!

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.380
After them!

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.970
Don't let them get away!

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.040
Nothing here!

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.410
Where did they go?

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.170
Over there!

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.300
After them!

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.400
Luoluo.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.410
How did you end up here?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.830
What's wrong?

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.510
My Lord.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.200
Xiao Yao.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.840
You're finally back.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.920
But why...

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:21.680
Why...

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.910
Why did it take you so long?

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.000
Demons' Valley...

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.570
Demons' Valley...

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.690
What happened to Demons' Valley?

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.720
Xiao Yao, shortly after you left,

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.030
Heiwu led Wu Huan

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.640
in a surprise attack on
Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.160
Xiao Ming and Xiao Mu were badly injured,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.360
and we still don't know where they went.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.340
Just like that,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.170
Demons' Valley fell under Heiwu's control.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.330
He also claimed that you were dead,
My Lord,

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.720
and that all demons
must obey him from then on.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.480
He completely removed
Demons' Valley's barrier

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.960
and let the Feiyu Guards in.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.790
On the 1st and 15th of each month
in the human calendar,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.620
he forces us demons to draw lots.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480
Those who are chosen

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.030
are sent with the Feiyu Guards
as offerings to the human emperor.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.830
Now everyone in the valley
lives in constant fear,

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.370
not knowing who will be next.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.160
I was so terrified

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.880
that I escaped.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680
It's all my fault.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.620
If I had known,
before I left Demons' Valley,

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.280
I should have killed Heiwu.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.120
I originally thought he was merely greedy,

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.960
but I never imagined

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.680
he would dare to collude with
the Feiyu Guards

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.790
to harm his own kind

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.840
and commit such cruel acts.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.840
Now that you've returned, My Lord,

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.310
please stand up for us
and help us reclaim Demons' Valley.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:46.860
Don't worry.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.530
Now that we're back,

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.550
we'll definitely teach
the Feiyu Guards and Heiwu a lesson.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.160
But

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.380
we'll need to
think this through carefully.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.750
Tonight is the 15th.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.680
In another 15 days,
it will be the 1st again.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.680
H-How can we possibly have time
to think this through?

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.430
Have a drink for courage,

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.080
and we'll fight our way back to
Demons' Valley.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.530
I like the sound of that.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.170

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.440
I suppose in the human realm,

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.920
you'll have a better life.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.350
Let's go.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:58.230
Let's.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.750
My Lord.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.920
Demons' Valley is
over 1,000 miles from here.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.300
A-Aren't we going to fly there?

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.320
I have other important matters
to attend to on the way. Let's go.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.440
B-But yesterday was the 15th.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.920
If we go on foot,

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.550
we won't reach Demons' Valley
even in another 15 days.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.410
Then we'll run.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.880
We just need to hurry.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:15.920
What about Xiao Yao?

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.980
No more questions.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.970
But how long will it take
if we run there...

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.440
Our promised day off is canceled again.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.880
Wasn't the head of the Feiyu Guards

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.080
arrested on the spot?

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.920
Why didn't they kill him right there?

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.920
Would've saved us all this trouble.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.060
Just hang in there.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.350
Once he's executed tomorrow,

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.440
things will quiet down.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.200
Good thing he doesn't have
any close family.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.880
Otherwise, for the crime of
deceiving His Majesty,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.590
his entire clan would be executed.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.400
Just the beheadings alone
would take quite a while.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400
Didn't they say

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.070
he embezzled His Majesty's
Yuli Spring water?

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.540
If this Yuli Spring water
really grants immortality,

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.350
will they even be able to

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.810
cut his head off tomorrow?

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.790
Immortality doesn't mean
he has a head made of iron, okay?

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:05.830
Then do you think

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.270
once his head is cut off,

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.000
a new one will grow in its place?

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.960
You must help me.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.940
The criminal, Bingzhu,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.920
used his position as Demon Slayer
of the Feiyu Guards

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.040
to collude with Demon King Hong Ye,

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.630
sacrificing innocent lives

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.550
in exchange for demonic patronage,

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.400
fraudulently obtaining court salary

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.030
and royal rewards.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.520
His Majesty received guidance
from the Immortal,

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.840
which only fueled Bingzhu's greed

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.590
even further—

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.640
he embezzled the spring water

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.650
and harmed the daughters of
100 high-ranking court officials.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.680
His treasonous intentions
were clear as day.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.550
Today, he entered the palace
to see His Majesty

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.000
only to assassinate him.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.750
Fortunately, His Majesty
saw through his plan,

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.570
and the Feiyu Guards protected
His Majesty with all their might.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.500
With multiple witnesses present,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.120
he finally confessed

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.840
to all these evil deeds.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.180
As former colleagues,

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.390
there's not much I can do for you.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.160
This is the best I can do.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.440
As long as you sign these charges

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.590
and put your thumbprint on them,

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.240
I won't subject you to further torture.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.100
What do you say?

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.110
Why should I confess to

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.310
things I never did?

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.590
Lord Bingzhu.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.110
You've been devoted to
protecting the people,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.110
b-but that should be
His Majesty's concern.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:49.510
Your colleagues here are human too,
just like the common people.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.240
Have you ever thought about us?

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.200
You've protected the people for years,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.000
but do you even know their names?

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:57.750
Look at your colleagues around you,

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.310
and your sister Tan'er—

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.680
which one of them
have you managed to protect?

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.350
This is your only chance

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.030
to do something for us.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.350
We'll all remember your great kindness,

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.910
and it wouldn't be in vain that we

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.590
risked our lives alongside you.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.720
The predecessors of the Feiyu Guards

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.970
paved the way with their blood,

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.560
yet now you all

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.440
greedily take bribes and abuse the law,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.030
persecuting the loyal and upright.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.880
How truly pitiful.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.600
So you refuse to sign, right?

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.410
That's fine.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.200
His Majesty only said to
keep you alive until execution,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.730
but he didn't say
you had to remain intact.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.900
If I cut off this hand of yours,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.510
I can use it to sign

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.190
as many charges as I want.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.120
Someone!

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.030
Yes!

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.000
Do it.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.070
My Lord,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.920
we also have

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.320
no other option.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.760
Someone's attempting a prison break!

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:09.180
Let me go!

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.690
Bingzhu risked his life
for the imperial orders,

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.610
yet you framed him
and put him in death row.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.510
You Feiyu Guards,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.320
each and every one of you,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.290
have you all lost your conscience?

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.020
You insolent demoness.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.760
Form the formation!

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.420
My Lord.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.300
She's human.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.570
I'm afraid the formation won't work.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.840
Then why waste words?

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.360
Attack together!

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:35.750
Yes!

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.300
Attack!

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.850
Tan'er,

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.510
if you don't help now,

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.440
we'll all die here today!

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.110
Tan'er!

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.150
Tan'er, protect Pianpian!

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.650
Tan'er!

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.440
Everyone, no need to be afraid!

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.230
Her demon-slaying blade

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.400
can only kill demons.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.300
It can't harm us.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.440
We just need to
block the cell door tightly

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.320
so she can't get near Bingzhu.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:09.580
Tan'er!

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.860
Take Pianpian out of here!

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.790
Hurry up and leave!

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:32.280
Feiyu Guards!

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.960
Yes!

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.880
No one is allowed to sleep tonight!

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.940
Bring all the Feiyu Guards in the city

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.920
and spare no effort to hunt down
that demoness who broke into prison!

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.030
We must not let her disturb His Majesty

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.230
during the execution tomorrow!

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.000
Yes!

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.030
Hurry!

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.880
It's already the fifth watch.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.490
Are there any ways left
to save your brother?

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.110
How beautiful.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.400
Without a sincere heart,

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.550
one's fate is sealed.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.190
Is that the Exalted Immortal?

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.930
You're not destined for immortality.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.590
It's all just a fleeting dream in the end.
