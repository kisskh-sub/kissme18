[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 16]

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.710
Tan'er.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.920
Tan'er?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.400
Didn't you want to find my true form?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.680
Here I am.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.500
I was confused.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.660
I have failed you, Immortal Lord.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.680
You certainly were confused.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.720
Miss Pianpian.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.210
Lu Pianpian.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.420
The murderer who killed your brother

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.880
is right before your eyes.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.870
Back then,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.540
he used this demon-slaying blade

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.600
to kill your brother with his own hands.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.760
I have wronged you, Immortal Lord.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.630
I willingly accept my death.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.380
I was the one who deceived Miss Pianpian.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.870
Dreamshard,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.990
even if you tear me into pieces

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.800
and use me as fertilizer for your flowers,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.310
I won't resist.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.280
I only beg you to let Miss Pianpian go.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.490
Bingzhu,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.829
still so smooth with your words.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.030
Take these two to Biexin Courtyard.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.000
Let everyone see

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.310
the consequences of
naively trusting humans.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.080
[Lovely and intelligent]

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.610
If it weren't for a man,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.220
Pianpian could have enjoyed

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.840
being second only to one

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.769
and above all others in privilege.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.510
But she was blind,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.360
choosing to believe the sweet talk
of this Feiyu Guard

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.000
and repaid Immortal Lord's kindness
with betrayal.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.860
Immortal Lord cared for Pianpian

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.760
and gave her several chances.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.000
But she was bewitched by that wretched man

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.159
and repeatedly tried
to harm Immortal Lord.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.870
In the end,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.740
this man

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.020
turned out to be her brother's killer.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.350
Such people
who can't tell right from wrong

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.560
don't deserve to become an immortal.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.740
Today,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.260
venomous insects will

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.120
turn them into living corpses.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.310
They will stand in Biexin Court
forever after,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.830
as a warning to all.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.730
What's that?

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.560
The venomous insect!

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.270
The venomous insect.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.080
Master Bingzhu.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.210
Thank you for treating me
to delicious food.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.340
I had no choice either.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.380
I failed to protect all of you.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.490
Pianpian.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.360
At the brink of death,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.800
do you have any last words?

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.830
I have followed Immortal Lord
for 16 years,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.190
and have long regarded her
as my only family.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.880
Every command from Immortal Lord,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.810
I have obeyed without exception.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.560
Luring people to the island,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.520
keeping those who submit,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.800
humiliating those who err,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.970
punishing them,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.190
and killing them.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.000
I also extract human essence…

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.780
What is she talking about?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.030
Harm their physical bodies,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.880
and destroy their souls.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.560
Whatever Immortal Lord asked me to do,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.210
I never once refused.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.430
That can't be true.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.630
How is that possible?

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.950
She must be talking nonsense.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.000
Immortal Lord isn't that kind of person.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.720
Exactly.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.430
It's impossible.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.160
Right.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.270
Pianpian,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.930
you brought this on yourself,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.190
yet how dare you
slander Immortal Lord here.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.630
I remember all the kindness
from Immortal Lord,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.050
but what I've done

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.409
I can never forget.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.720
Every day, I'm tormented by inner conflict—

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.380
the suffering is unbearable.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.720
So I can only punish myself.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.930
Only when my body hurts enough

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.330
can my heart feel somewhat relieved.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.190
When the heart wavers,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.480
slander finds its way in.

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:54.040
It's your own weak conviction

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.370
that made you fall for a man's deception.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.370
I am useless.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.520
Following Immortal Lord every day,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.410
yet making no progress at all.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.400
Immortal Lord wishes to return
to the celestial mountain,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.620
but someone like me

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.930
is of no benefit to Immortal Lord.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.840
But my life was given by Immortal Lord.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.920
[Lovely and intelligent]

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.000
Now,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.810
I'm willing to give my life

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.890
back to Immortal Lord.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.720
What is she trying to do?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.920
Release Lu Pianpian!

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.780
Still acting like you're deeply devoted?

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.000
As long as you release Lu Pianpian,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.480
I'm willing to help Dreamshard

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.510
collect
the fragments of the Kunlun Mirror.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.360
Miss Zhirui.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.160
[Lovely and intelligent]

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.220
Has Immortal Lord given any response

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.590
about when Hong Ye will be returned to me?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.680
Immortal Lord

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.190
is not someone you can
negotiate with as you please.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.850
Then what will it take
for you to release Hong Ye?

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.560
You should think about

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.600
what else you can do.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.270
Fine.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.580
If you are willing to release Hong Ye,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.049
I am willing to join Master Bingzhu

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.049
in seeking the fragments
of the Kunlun Mirror for you.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.200
Both of you,

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.910
follow me to Linghua Palace.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.520
You two think you can find
the Kunlun Mirror?

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.450
Yes,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.440
the two of us can.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.030
If we can truly recover
the mirror fragment,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.480
you must release Tan'er

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.270
and Miss Pianpian.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.500
Where do you plan to start looking from?

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.800
With determination,

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.270
even stones can be split.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.360
Besides,

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.960
Immortal Lord will surely
give us some clues,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.560
won't you?

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.440
Then I shall give you one clue.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.290
Mount Qiansui.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.220
There's a legend
in both human and demon realms

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.630
that a fragment of the Kunlun Mirror
is hidden in Mount Qiansui.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.390
But it's guarded by Taotie,
the extremely ferocious ancient beast.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.870
Neither humans nor demons

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.200
can approach it.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.240
The lucky ones get injured,
the unlucky ones die.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.130
Hong Ye.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.560
Wait for me.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.000
I promise I'll get you out of here.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.500
Be careful!

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.880
What is this thing?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.170
It's a spirit herb

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.200
that I brought from Demons' Valley.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.030
Perhaps

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.020
it hasn't been watered for a while
and is throwing a tantrum.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.080
I'll be right back.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.200
Are you a dog?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.260
Why did you bite me?

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:46.840
I...

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.750
What are you trying to prove?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.750
Do you think Mount Qiansui
is a place for ordinary people?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.510
You wouldn't even fill
the gaps in Taotie's teeth.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.330
There's a Demon Slayer here, isn't there?

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.050
Him?

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.200
He's even more dangerous.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.150
Dreamshard Immortal is truly wicked,

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.240
sending you alone with a man.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.550
Are you jealous?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.360
I'm not.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.270
During this journey,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.630
when you're with him,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.150
you must be cautious at all times.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.960
Keep your distance

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.760
and don't cross any boundaries.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.440
Go back.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.750
I'll tickle you!

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.580
It had enough to drink.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.430
Immortal Lord let them leave the island
so easily.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440
Does she really believe

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.770
they can find the Kunlun Mirror fragment?

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.700
Mount Qiansui

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.150
is guarded by Taotie.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.870
Everyone knows that.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.730
Many have tried to find that fragment

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.750
but never returned.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.780
You mean

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.680
finding the mirror fragment
is just an excuse,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.600
but she's actually sending them
to their deaths?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.790
It takes Hong Ye

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.870
to find the fragments.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.700
Master Bingzhu
and Xiao Yao are mere mortals.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.290
What use could they be?

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.550
If they realize they're no match
for Taotie

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.290
and flee as soon as they reach shore,

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.220
wouldn't that be too easy for them?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.320
That would be even better.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.790
Isn't Hong Ye convinced
their love is unbreakable?

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.890
Seeing his beloved run off
with another man

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.260
is the only way he'll finally give up.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.120
Lu Pianpian is still waiting eagerly
in prison.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.000
Let her see

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.600
how unreliable

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.370
a man's promises can be.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.960
With no one at the helm,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.420
I wonder where the wind
will carry this boat.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.550
The wind comes from
the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.950
It will naturally take us
to Mount Qiansui.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.520
Let me ask you something.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.900
Why did you kill Pianpian's brother?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.600
Lu Tong was severely poisoned
at that time.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.370
He had already lost all his humanity.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.850
I had no other choice.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.630
Then why didn't you tell her?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.960
She's suffered enough already.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.900
Knowing that would only add to her sorrow.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.400
Let her keep

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.100
the memory of her heroic brother

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.700
as something to hold onto.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.450
Isn't that better?

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.980
We've arrived at Mount Qiansui.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.300
The quickest way
to find the mirror fragment

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.850
is to find Taotie first.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.670
We need to be wary not just of demons,

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.930
but also of this place.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.880
If you're ordinary villagers,
come out now!

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.860
Otherwise, you'll all be
treated as bandits!

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:12.580
Officer,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.670
forgive my poor eyesight.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.530
Please forgive my poor eyesight.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.550
But that arrow just now

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.480
clearly came from that direction.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.270
Li!

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.270
Come out now!

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.130
The officer has already seen you.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.490
Hurry up.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.650
You shot those three arrows just now?

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.670
[Li]

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.030
Yes.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.720
Your archery is not bad.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.840
Officer,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.000
he failed to recognize you.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.440
You can't even tell officials
from bandits?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.360
Are you saying

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.070
my Feiyu Guard uniform

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.460
isn't obvious enough?

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.750
No, no, Officer.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.480
I was blind!

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.120
We truly have nothing left.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.440
Please spare us.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.870
The village has nothing left
to pay taxes with,

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.550
Officer...

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.740
I'm not here to collect taxes,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.990
only to exterminate demons.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.440
Good.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.150
Good.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.320
Thank you.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.380
-Thank you, Officer. Thank you, Officer.
-Do you know where the demon is?

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.090
That demon

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.630
was wreaking havoc
in our village just days ago.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.630
Many houses were destroyed by them.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.450
Lead the way.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.240
Here.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.550
I'll show you.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.770
Li, how many years
have you been an archer?

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.510
Your draw strength is sufficient,

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.440
but your rear elbow
isn't level when drawing,

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.620
you release too quickly,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.080
so your accuracy suffers.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.150
Please don't blame him, Officer.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.990
Li is our village's best hunter.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.390
He wasn't always like this.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.810
Since his wife was devoured by Taotie,

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.710
he's become somewhat deranged.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.050
Please don't hold it against him.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:56.850
That's right.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.910
Does Taotie appear often?

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.390
Yes.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.720
Taotie has turned

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.050
our village into ruins.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.570
It's terrifying.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.920
It has three heads, six arms,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.120
and huge bloody jaws.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.460
It can swallow

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.360
a fully grown man whole.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.190
Yes, if you anger it,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.250
it breathes fire from its mouth.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.320
Wherever the flames touch,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.720
nothing grows again.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.450
Officer,

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.250
our village is just ahead.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:23.800
Let's go.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.270
I'll show you around the village.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:25.870
Please.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.640
Let's go.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.720
It's terrifying.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.550
Our village

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.290
is in terrible shape now.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.550
Officer,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.880
this is our village.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.510
Take a look.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.890
This is all Taotie's doing.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.790
This house belonged to Ding Laosan.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.790
His family of four couldn't escape.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.040
Officers,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.270
there's another one ahead.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.130
Let me show you.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.460
This monster terrorizes our village daily.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.320
You have no idea.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.750
The villagers are so frightened

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.880
they barely dare to leave their homes.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.880
Ya, come to Grandma quickly.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.150
Tribe Leader,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:40.310
an official is here.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.310
Hurry, leader!

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.030
Come welcome our distinguished guests.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.770
Sir.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.080
Greetings to both of you.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.440
Please come inside.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.750
This way, please.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.590
Please.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.000
Leader,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.440
Li just shot an arrow at them
at the village entrance.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.720
He probably made them angry.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.000
[Tribe Leader]

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.480
Sheng,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.720
you two should go back.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.520
Alright, we'll head back first.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.890
Sir and Madam,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.030
please sit.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.010
Have a seat.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.090
No need to trouble yourself, Leader.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.350
It's no trouble at all.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.790
Let me pour you some tea.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.680
Sir, as you've seen on your way here,

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.830
you must have noticed

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.920
how our houses

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.310
and lands are completely devastated.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.680
Moreover,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.590
the villagers never know
where their next meal will come from.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.680
They're constantly harmed by Taotie.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.440
Nowadays,

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.640
whether farming or hunting,

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.920
people must go in groups.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.160
I would like to ask for your forgiveness

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.270
for the young men just now

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.880
who have offended you.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.160
Leader,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.550
are the claw marks on the wall

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.190
all left by Taotie?

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.400
Yes,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.790
indeed.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.550
Leader,

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.160
are there any other traces left by Taotie?

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.090
Would you please

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.160
show us?

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.750
Yes.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:54.830
Well,

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.790
Sir.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.880
No...

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.880
No matter how skilled you are,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.210
you're still just one person alone.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:01.960
So—

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.590
No, no.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.620
You're stronger than him.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.720
But

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.240
there are only two of you.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.400
It's better to not disturb that monster.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.240
In the past,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.000
government troops came several times,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.200
-and they were scared away.
-They don't know how to catch demons.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.360
The two of us

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.110
will not leave

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.030
until we eliminate Taotie.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:22.490
Mm-hmm.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.730
I just want to see the traces
left by Taotie,

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.830
yet you're making various excuses.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.970
Don't tell me you want me

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.070
to send a tax collector instead.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.590
If that's the case,

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.490
then...

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.830
Sir,

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.330
please follow me.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:44.820
Look.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.710
These large footprints.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.480
Look.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.090
Especially that wall.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.370
The handprints.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.740
Claw marks.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.480
Were all these left by Taotie?

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.160
Yes, yes.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.100
This blood too?

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.400
That's right.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.070
Taotie's blood?

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.350
No,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.110
it's Wang Er's wife's.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.040
Xiao Yao.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.800
Told you it'd scare her off.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.650
What footprints and handprints?

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.590
The paint too?

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.790
You might fool others,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.550
but not me.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.400
I used to make a living from this.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.470
But this Taotie...

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.640
did it ever really appear?

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.640
Li, have you decided yet?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.200
Are you going to meet her or not?

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.720
It'd be nice

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.790
to have a girl marry in this village.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.240
Other families are lining up asking me
to arrange marriages—

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.440
but look at you.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.840
If the girl hadn't taken a liking to you,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.660
I wouldn't even bother
wasting my breath on you.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.160
This boy...

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.850
Tell them

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.160
I already have a wife.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:36.830
[Zixiu]

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.490
Are you playing hide and seek?

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.590
I want to play too.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.030
If you don't play with me, I'll scream.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.400
Don't scream, don't scream.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.400
Let's play.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.860
I'll hide and you find me.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.830
What's this?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.620
They made Taotie into an archery target.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.550
This is Taotie?

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.440
Actually,
Taotie doesn't look like this at all.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.020
You've seen it?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.700
Mm-hmm.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.350
Where did you see it?

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.830
Play hide and seek with me first,

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.890
then I'll tell you.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.750
Aren't I playing with you already?

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.990
Then close your eyes.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.440
Okay.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.320
I'll count to five.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.830
After five, I'll open my eyes.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.550
Run quickly.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.440
Don't cheat.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.880
I won't cheat.
I play fair.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.310
One.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.640
Two.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.660
Three.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.680
Five.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.440
I'm coming to catch you!

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.160
If I get you,

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.570
you have to come back to my cave with me.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960
Come find me!

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.750
Come on!

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.300
I'll catch you!

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.170
Did it scare you?

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.580
It scared you, didn't it?

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.690
Xiao Yao.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.160
Why did you come so far?

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.350
I couldn't find you anywhere.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.640
I thought something had happened to you.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.550
It's nothing.
I was just playing with this child.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.550
But I was startled by this painting.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.550
Zixiu.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.750
This isn't a place
you should be running around.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.750
Go home.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.200
I'm not done playing yet.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.790
Stop playing around.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.830
All you think about is playing.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.590
Let me tell you.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.640
If Taotie finds you,
it will cost you your life.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.930
But I still want to play!

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:41.790
Go back. Go back.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.390
Back. Now.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.550
I found

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.960
this child

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.110
when I was hunting in the mountains.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.750
I searched for a long time

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.840
but couldn't find his parents.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.020
They probably met with disaster.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.440
This child has had a hard life.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.880
So now

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.510
we're letting him stay in the village,

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.720
giving him food to eat.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.250
He just offended you, Miss.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.350
Please don't blame him.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.350
-No, no.
-Why is there an arrow hole?

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.110
That was drawn by Li.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.510
He uses it as a target.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.300
It's getting late.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.410
We shan't disturb the villagers.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.200
We'll rest here tonight.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.100
Well...

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.460
Shall I bring you a charcoal brazier?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.210
Yes, please.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.070
All the traces left by Taotie
in this village

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.550
were done by a human.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.020
The footprints

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.240
and claw marks

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.520
are all created very shabbily.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.620
The blood stains
are the most ridiculous of all.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.270
I suspect

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.440
they've never seen a Taotie before.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.900
The Baize Drawings say

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.750
a Taotie has a sheep's body
with a human face.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.080
Its eyes are located under its armpits,

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.110
completely different from this one.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.680
Regardless of whether this drawing
depicts the real Taotie,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.510
but from what Li did today,

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.590
I can tell

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.330
he must have seen the real demon before.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:19.710
By the way,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920
that kid just now

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.400
told me today

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.550
he has seen Taotie before.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.030
Him?

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.880
I don't know if it's true.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.790
Here's what we'll do.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.960
Tomorrow you go find Li,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.920
and I'll find that child.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.160
We'll investigate further.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.550
Sure.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.320
All right.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.970
Xiao Yao!

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.920
What?

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.270
I need to talk to you about something.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.750
He's a single man
and you're a single woman—

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.200
it's inappropriate for you two

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.530
to using the same room.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.480
And also,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.830
since you two got on the boat,

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.200
this pretty boy—

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.440
I've felt that

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.920
he has ulterior motives toward you.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.780
Furthermore,

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.030
I'd rather

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.000
you stayed with Luoluo

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.270
than him!

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:03.960
Do you get it?

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.110
Little mantis, watch your tongue.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.590
Shut up!

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.920
Who are you calling little mantis?

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.790
You shut up.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.600
What's wrong
with being in the same room as him?

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.650
Are we doing anything shameful?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.240
We're discussing important matters.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.400
Yet you're projecting
your own indecent thoughts onto others.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.200
How dare you

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:17.710
blabber on

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.160
and on.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.270
Let me tell you,

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.570
you two being together is unacceptable!

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.770
You like Luoluo, don't you?

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.370
I'll let you see him right now.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.810
Luoluo, right?

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.240
Luoluo!

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.530
Weren't you blabbering on?

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.970
What? I can't hear you.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.790
Still can't hear you.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.830
Speak louder!

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.480
Aren't you supposed to be tough?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.030
Aren't you tough?

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:01.960
That's...

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.960
well drawn.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.040
It's alright.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.140
Did it hurt?

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.160
Get out!

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.750
Taotie is here!

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.590
Taotie is here!

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.350
Taotie is here!

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.750
Taotie is here!

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.750
The demon is coming!

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.580
Kill it!

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.720
Kill it!

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.960
Sir, are you alright?

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.790
This Taotie

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.920
took advantage of the dark

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.000
and entered the village.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.110
It was spotted in front of Li's house.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.440
The villagers

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.270
have some experience dealing with it.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:06.920
Right, right.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.750
It didn't hurt anyone.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.810
They drove it away.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:09.550
Drove it away.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.160
It ran off.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.350
You drove it away?

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.070
Yes, yes.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.670
It's gone.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.280
It ran off.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.000
Well done.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.270
Let's press our advantage.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.270
Give me the blade.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:20.070
Sir,

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:20.700
look,

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.930
Li and the young men have already gone,

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.200
so there's no need to trouble yourself.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.830
Right, right.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.390
Sheng,

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.400
go check it out.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.110
Go, hurry.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.720
Quick, let's go.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.310
Sir and Madam,

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.920
get some rest.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.110
So,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.810
does it look familiar?

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.960
All too familiar.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.070
There's fresh blood
at the base of these scales,

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.800
and the footprints are so even.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.400
This doesn't seem like a human pretending.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.000
It must be a demon at least.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.440
Li!

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.110
They're back.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.510
You've returned.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.510
They're back.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.410
How did it go?

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.770
Another night wasted.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.430
Still couldn't catch it.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.790
So you all encountered Taotie?

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.030
Chased it all night,

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.230
but it got away again.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.160
It's fine if it escaped,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.440
as long as everyone is safe.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.370
Have some water.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.550
Here.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.280
Are you alright?

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.510
You went that way.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.110
Next time,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.880
we absolutely cannot let it escape again.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.160
Li,

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.240
may I see your arrow?

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.680
This arrowhead is poisoned,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.420
and bound with charms.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.680
It is indeed

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.810
the only way to fight demons right now.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.700
But if it's truly Taotie,

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.920
this is far from enough.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.480
I'm willing to help you

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.860
slay the demon and avenge.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.430
Li,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.400
I heard your wife

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.350
was killed by Taotie.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.430
Did you witness it yourself?

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.160
Could you tell me

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.200
the details?

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.310
Did you see what it looked like?

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.920
Sir,

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.550
please don't put Li on the spot.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.490
Leader.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.020
As a Feiyu Guard Demon Slayer...

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.110
It's my duty to eliminate demons
for the people.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.960
Yes, of course.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.240
If the demon isn't eliminated,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.680
more people will suffer
the pain of losing loved ones.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.540
Are you going to wait for that day?

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.350
Follow me.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.880
My wife's name was Ya'er.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.290
We grew up together.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.310
We were betrothed since childhood.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.920
After marriage, life was hard,

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.230
but there was sweetness in the bitterness.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.080
But later,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.550
the government taxes kept increasing,

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.570
and I happened to fall seriously ill,

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.030
so all our money

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.210
was spent on treating my illness.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.200
Tax day was approaching.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.020
I insisted on going hunting
in the mountains despite my illness.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.050
But Ya'er wouldn't allow it.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.450
She absolutely refused.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.360
While I was fast asleep,

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.000
she took the bow
and went to the mountains herself.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.090
She was gone for many days.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:07.230
She returned the day
before taxes were due.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.880
Not only did she bring back game,

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.240
she also brought back
a bottle of spring water.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.570
She said that on her way,

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.810
she met an immortal,

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.330
who gave her a bottle of

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.420
Yuli Spring water
that grants immortality.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.190
The water smelled foul to me,

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.040
so I refused to drink it.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.770
But Ya'er insisted I drink it.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.190
She said I would be cured
after drinking it.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.390
During our argument,

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.040
I accidentally pushed her,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.440
and broke the bottle.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.790
The shards also cut her hand.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.680
I deserve to die.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.410
If I had drunk that water then,

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.450
none of this would have happened.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.980
Go play by yourself.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.590
Do you know how to play jianzi?

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.270
No, I don't.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.070
I'll teach you.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.790
Don't mess around.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.390
Jianzi is really fun.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:09.920
I don't want to play.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.260
Just play with me for a while.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.700
Fine. Give it to me.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.940
What's wrong with you?

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.400
No need to throw it away
even if you're not playing with me.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.550
Here.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.270
Thank you.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.920
What's your name?

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:27.070
Zixiu.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:27.790
Zixiu.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.400
Yes.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.720
Do you remember you promised me yesterday

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.310
that if I played hide-and-seek with you,

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.910
you would tell me something?

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.900
Do you know how to play jianzi?

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.520
Of course.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.960
That's amazing!

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.720
Teach me!

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.460
Want to play something else?

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:51.750
Yes.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.280
Let's go.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.640
Later on,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.490
the tax officials came.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.400
They took away our game

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.270
and all the valuables in our home.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.680
They still thought it wasn't enough.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.810
Ya'er had to go to the mountains again.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.380
But when she went up this time,

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.719
she never came back.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:15.550
The villagers and I
searched for many days,

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.330
but couldn't find her.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.159
We only found her clothes

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:21.360
and...

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.610
this half jade pendant.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.929
This is my family heirloom,

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.510
our token of love.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.400
At the place
where I found the jade pendant,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.130
I also heard the howl of Taotie,

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.550
and saw a pair of eyes.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.550
What kind of eyes?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.320
Blood-red eyes.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.230
Hidden in the forest, staring at me.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.960
If I don't kill it,

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.160
I swear I am not human.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.440
Bear with it.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.160
Just cooperate.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.030
You're so nice, Miss,

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.710
just like Ya'er.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.030
Who is Ya'er?

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.240
She's Li's wife.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.440
Mm-hmm!

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.920
Before, only Ya'er would play with me,

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.890
sometimes bringing Li along too.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:32.910
What happened after?

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:35.200
Later, Ya'er disappeared

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.230
and Li changed too.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.510
Zixiu.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.110
Was Ya'er

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.630
really eaten by Taotie?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.630
No.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.960
But

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.840
many people in the village

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.310
died in strange ways.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.880
They don't even get coffins—

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.070
just wrapped in mats

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.670
and thrown in the graveyard.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.510
Follow me if you're not afraid.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.560
Let's go.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.250
We're here.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.440
Li said

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.870
at the place where Ya'er disappeared,

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.960
he also saw a pair of eyes like these.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.070
Can the dead become a living corpse?

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.760
This location is extremely yin,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.820
so it's hard to say.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:34.740
Don't be afraid.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.690
I'll set up a formation

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.420
to suppress the evil energy.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:42.930
I'm not afraid.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.000
Go and set it up.

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.360
Zixiu, come here.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:15.960
Okay.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.400
Listen,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.800
the rats are gnawing on human bones.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.060
The coins didn't move.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.500
It's likely someone playing tricks.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.710
I have done nothing wrong,

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.460
so I'm not afraid of ghosts knocking.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.480
Want to see a magic trick?

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.840
Yes.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.880
Blow on it.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.370
Fire!

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.280
Hurry!

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.480
Come put out the fire!

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:36.840
Leader!

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.390
-Leader!
-Leader!

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:39.370
Stomp it out!

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.760
That's it!

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.840
Quick!

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.960
Help!

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:47.440
Harder!

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.000
That's it!

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.920
Let's go!

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.380
Leader.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.090
Are you alright, Leader?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.480
The act fell through.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.670
Sir...

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.940
S-Sir...

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.280
You have such nerve,

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.280
daring to trick the Feiyu Guard.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:02.960
No.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.000
Sir, let me explain.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.150
Mount Qiansui has always been barren,

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.760
we truly cannot afford the taxes.

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.510
We had no choice

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.630
but to spread rumors
about monsters hurting people

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.150
and destroying fields and homes.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.590
Our goal was to keep officials
and outsiders away

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.230
so we could have a moment to breathe.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
We dressed as ghosts to scare people

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.160
out of desperation,

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.490
with no intention to harm anyone.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.960
Please understand our situation, Sir.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.070
Please be merciful, Sir!

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:31.920
Please be merciful.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.150
Since we entered the village,

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.150
we've been telling you

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.760
we're not here to collect money

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.150
but to capture monsters.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.880
Yet you still try to deceive us.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.230
I... I... I...

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.550
I had no choice.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.600
Well... Well...

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.030
I was once forced into
doing something like this too.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.630
Though they have deceived us,

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.510
they truly haven't hurt anyone.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.280
Get up.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:59.280
Thank you, Sir.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:40:59.760
Thank you, Sir!

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.320
Thank you, Sir.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:00.880
Thank you, Sir.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.340
Was Taotie from last night

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.160
also something you fabricated?

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.030
My Lord,

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.400
there really are monsters here.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.760
Strange incidents
have occurred in the village.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.640
Every time officials came,

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.320
they claimed
they would eliminate the monsters,

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.780
but they would always fail

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.000
and only add to the extortion—

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:17.320
Even so—

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.850
I'll say this one last time.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.510
The two of us came here

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.910
with no ulterior motive.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320
Only here to eliminate monsters.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:30.710
Yes.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.320
Then we're extremely grateful, Sir.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.110
Thank you, Sir.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.800
Thank you, Sir.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.840
But you must tell me everything

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.190
that has happened here in detail.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.590
Us.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.120
Do not...

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.440
hide anything.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.760
I wouldn't dare deceive you at all.
