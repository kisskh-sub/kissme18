=To Kill a Songbird=

Bird Kills Seven People)

(Jiang Saw Only Black and White)

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.160
If I must leave,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.080
I can stand anywhere.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.760
But I have things I must do.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.000
I cannot leave.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.319
Thank you for your guidance.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.160
Can you speak a bit closer?

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:55.160
Master Jiang, look here.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.440
How many blue strands

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.160
and red strands are there?

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760
Blue.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.680
- Red.
- Yes.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.520
Count them carefully.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.399
When you're done, close your eyes.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.039
I have something to ask you.

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.720
You have something to ask me?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
Blue.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.360
Red.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.880
No blue.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.119
No red either.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.000
Why?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.160
Why are there no blue or red?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.399
You're not very skilled.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.119
You even failed at confusing the mind.

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:51.000
It can't be my fault.

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:52.279
Then whose fault is it?

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.880
It's his eyes.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.639
Jiang Chun.

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:00.600
Yes.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.199
13 years ago,

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.199
you lived in Huachang County, right?

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:05.479
Yes.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.759
How old were you then?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.039
14.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.000
You picked up a severed head,
didn't you?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.880
Yes.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.360
How did you come across that head?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.479
I didn't pick it up myself.

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:20.320
I...

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.479
I went to fetch it.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:25.600
That night,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.960
it rained heavily.

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.000
My father slipped on duty
and broke his leg.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.360
The magistrate's office
didn't want to rehire him.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.759
I wanted to ask
my father's colleagues again

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.399
to put in a good word for him.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.440
But I think I got lost.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.000
The rain was heavy,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.880
and it was dark all around.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.800
I took shelter under a random eave.

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:48.199
Coincidentally,

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.520
I heard two people
talking inside a house.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.800
It's nearly ruined.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.390
Take it to the magistrate's office
tomorrow for the reward.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.839
And the reward money from that gentleman

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.380
should be able to let us
live comfortably for a few years.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.320
Is the location safe?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.679
Qili Slope is a place no one goes to.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.279
I didn't understand
what they were saying at the time,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.839
only that there was reward money.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.119
If there was money,

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.960
I could hire a physician
to heal my father's leg.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.679
I feared they would dig up the treasure

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:19.480
the next day,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.320
so I ran to Qili Slope that night.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.160
From the slope,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.600
I dug up the long-missing head

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:29.480
of Shen Xiu, the murder victim.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.119
I think I heard about this case too.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.799
You did all this just to investigate?

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.160
What's your connection to it?

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:44.239
Could it be

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.440
that you're a victim?

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:48.760
Alright, I get it.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.880
No more questions.

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:51.000
Stay away and be a dog.

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:55.679
Do you have a problem with your eyes?

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:57.559
Yes.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.519
I'm colorblind.

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:02.799
I can only see black and white.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.000
Some people made a fuss,

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:07.519
insisting on blue and red.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.959
Yet he cannot see them at all.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.799
Who did you

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.079
go to for help?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.959
Do you remember where they lived?

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.799
The first person I went to
lived on Yuehua Street.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.920
East of the county magistrate's office.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.679
There were many alleys. I got lost.

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:28.160
But the general direction was correct.

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:29.239
You want to find

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600
the house that hid the head?

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.119
If you follow his directions,

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:35.519
you probably won't find it.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.399
In the fifth year of Chongning,

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:40.760
there was a fire around Yuehua Street.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.959
The 5 lanes and 19 streets

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:44.679
were all rebuilt.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.359
Locations, sizes, and residents

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:49.679
were all very different
from 13 years ago.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.279
How do you know?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.040
Since I came to Huachang County,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.320
I would check the local county records

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.640
and other case files.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.000
Coincidentally,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.640
I also have a photographic memory.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.920
So don't bother

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.959
trying to scare me
with your so-called poison.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:10.760
If I get scared,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.239
I might forget everything.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.799
How could I do that?

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.519
I still

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.480
have to rely on you.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:27.160
Come over.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:28.600
Get to work.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:31.640
Me?

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.480
You've been called here too?

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.679
Who is this old man?

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:00.839
Why is he so fierce?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.359
Mr. Cui San is the county coroner.

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:05.040
You can offend the county magistrate,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.959
but never offend

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.119
Mr. Cui.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.079
This old man

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.640
tricked us into doing labor.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.959
Where did he go?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.880
This young lady

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.920
is extremely bold.

00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:55.920
Are you sure he won't remember this
when he wakes up?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.640
Normally, he wouldn't.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.720
And if he does?

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.399
Then I'm doomed.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.480
And

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.440
I'll take you down with me.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.839
Give him

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:07.720
one of your Don't Defy.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:09.119
You think it's a jujube cake

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:10.040
that's always available?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.160
It's the only one,
and it's been used on you.

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.640
We might as well go all in.

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:17.799
How about

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.559
locking him up with Fan Jili?

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.640
No need to test me.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.990
No need to get this close either.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.260
County Magistrate Jiang.

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:33.359
Sorry for knocking you out earlier.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.520
But you have to understand me.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.280
Suddenly seeing a man

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.039
break into my fiancée's room,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.559
it's normal that I didn't react gently.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.599
Fiancée?

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.840
She...

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.039
She's Divine Lady Thrush
of Xuezhao Residence.

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.400
What's with Divine Lady Thrush?

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.440
I fell in love with Yuan Yuan
at first sight.

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:53.440
Yuan Yuan

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:55.440
also agreed to be with me forever.

00:08:56.239 --> 00:08:58.599
Besides, when I fell into the water
a few days ago,

00:08:58.599 --> 00:08:59.750
it was Yuan Yuan who saved me.

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:02.559
Since then, I kept thinking of her.

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:05.280
Ms. Li.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:05.960
You...

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:07.679
Thank you for understanding.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.919
Shi is the fate I cannot escape.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.159
I voluntarily stayed here

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:14.960
to marry him.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.119
In that case,

00:09:20.599 --> 00:09:21.919
I acted unnecessarily.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.640
Farewell.

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.919
Yuan Yuan?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.960
(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)
Fate I cannot escape.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.025
In terms
of being cheesy and exaggerated,

00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:07.960
you're no worse than me.

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:11.239
This guy is quite strong,

00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:12.400
but he's not very clever.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.679
We actually fooled him with nonsense.

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:16.479
Still not as good as you.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.280
Extremely cunning

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.840
and full of lies.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.479
You lied.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.880
What do you mean?

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:28.640
You were just talking nonsense.

00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:29.840
Tell me.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.320
What did you do to me?

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.239
Jiang Chun, don't forget

00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:35.039
I'm your superior.

00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:36.520
You speak,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.280
or you speak.

00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:41.599
How dare a mere county magistrate...

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.440
Don't yell.

00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:45.840
Don't you want to know
how the head came about?

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.039
I'm a warrior,

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.840
not a fool.

00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:52.719
Fan Jili had just died,

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:53.679
and you came for me.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.679
How could it be so coincidental?

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.039
I had no dealings with Fan Jili.

00:10:58.239 --> 00:11:00.440
The only connection is the Thrush Case.

00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:03.760
You're investigating it.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.039
Since seven or eight years ago,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.640
I run down this street daily.

00:11:19.359 --> 00:11:20.000
Why?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.119
A child of ten

00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:23.520
may indeed understand nothing,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.679
but does one remain clueless forever?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.640
When I grew older,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.239
I figured out the key points

00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:35.239
and understood the mystery of that head.

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:38.799
I could no longer find peace.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.640
You want to find
the people who talked that night.

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:44.200
Investigate every doubt.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.520
But many years have passed.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.440
I need solid evidence

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:50.210
to continue the investigation.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.990
The people who talked that night
are solid evidence.

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:56.200
But the fire on Yuehua Street

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.640
changed everything.

00:11:58.359 --> 00:11:59.840
Finding them again after so many years

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.359
would be extremely difficult.

00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:02.320
Yes.

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:06.039
But with the county magistrate
from Bian Jing here,

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:08.559
things are very different.

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:15.359
I have a feeling

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:16.880
that you two

00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:18.640
are even more closely linked.

00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:23.039
Since our goals align,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.440
why did you attack us just now?

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.760
Because I was a bit upset earlier.

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:30.960
I...

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.000
Since Magistrate Lu
has seen the original maps,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.200
we might as well compare on site.

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:44.790
Helping County Magistrate Jiang recall
is easy,

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:46.000
but

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:48.640
to survey and pinpoint locations
on the spot

00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.119
won't be easy.

00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:05.280
Yuehua Street ran east-west,

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:07.679
about 1.5 li long and 2 zhang wide.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.119
What lay to either side,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.239
and how far away?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.239
To the north lay Yongquan Lane,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.359
one zhang away.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.239
To the south was the market,
two zhang away.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:21.359
The street had 126 households,
shops, and land plots.

00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:23.280
Arranged systematically.

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:25.559
Each about 1.5 zhang wide.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.640
That day I walked toward higher ground.

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:30.400
it should be due east.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.599
I ran
for half a tea session's time at first.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.440
I passed dozens of houses

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.200
before coming across a fork in the road

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.000
and got lost.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.280
But I felt the direction was right.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.200
The direction was right,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.520
so the two forks weren't straight paths.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.359
Probably with a small angle in between.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.039
The path going in one direction
should be

00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:54.239
Chunxing Street.

00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:56.559
The fork branched into a crossroad.

00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:00.359
You could see
a white pagoda in the distance

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.960
from one side.

00:14:12.479 --> 00:14:13.559
That night's hut

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.559
should be right here.

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:25.587
