00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.390
Jie Chuan

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.600
really handed the Sun Artifact

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.670
back to the immortals?

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.720
Your Grace,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.940
he's only posted a few demon generals

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.200
to guard it,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.360
claiming it's shared

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.520
by immortals and demons,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.040
and both sides seem content.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.760
How generous,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760
trying to buy loyalty

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.480
and keep the dual throne.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.000
I won't let that stand.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.920
If the Artifact disappears,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.760
chaos will split the realms.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.280
By then,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.350
as fated doom of Jie Chuan,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.480
Ji Li will kill him,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310
and everything will return to right.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.920
So, this is the immortals' scheme.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.710
What do you want

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.560
to use Ji Li for?

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.350
Jie Chuan,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.070
you're trapped;

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.400
death is certain.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.330
Knowing this changes nothing.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.070
You've known

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.710
Ji Li is the knife,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.350
yet your love is rooted deep.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.480
Could you ever kill her?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.960
As expected,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.400
whoever has feelings

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.190
will only fail.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.960
Neither the Artifact nor the throne

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.200
is fit for you.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.030
Master.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.590
Ji Li.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.120
Master,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.910
you and Feng Tian came

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.800
to steal the Artifact?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.200
Ji Li.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.240
Master,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.120
can't our people live in peace?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.360
Feng Tian

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.750
is no longer

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.240
the sovereign.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.400
Why obey?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.400
Do it.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.400
Don't you dare.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.400
How useless.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.310
Master!

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.240
Master...

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.800
Jie Chuan, if you want the dual throne,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.280
take it!

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.680
The Artifact is already broken;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.840
its fragments reincarnated

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.870
with Hong Zhua.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.800
No one shall get

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.430
what I cannot possess.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.870
As expected,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.240
with the Artifact destroyed,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.170
Hunling City was caught in the backlash.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.960
We still have

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.280
the afterglow of the Artifact;

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.240
once we find it,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.000
everything will be fine.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.430
Feng Tian cast the Artifact

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.750
and Master into the reincarnation cycle.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.710
They could be

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.550
anywhere now.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.800
It's okay.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.360
The Sun Artifact

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.530
cannot hide its light.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.080
Let's follow the glow.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.710
But

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.280
without the Artifact,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.950
Hunling City, besieged by mixed Miasma,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.920
is failing;

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.000
it can't withstand strong spells.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.720
If the city collapses,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.440
all Three Realms will perish.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.680
We can only use the gentle spells.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.400
Sure.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.580
(Hong Residence)

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.440
Jie Chuan,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.830
there's light inside.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.510
The Artifact must be in that house.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.480
(Hong Residence)

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.720
Hong Baoyu is so greedy.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.920
If he weren't handsome,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.310
I'd have thrashed him long ago.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.160
Yeah.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.360
He was born with jade.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.070
What a waste.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.630
Born with jade...

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.680
(The Artifact should be on him.)

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.750
(Why is there nothing?)

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.160
(Could it be here?)

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.560
Young lady,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.830
why burst into my chamber

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.720
at night?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.470
Master...

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.310
(Hong Baoyu)

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.480
If you want this,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.160
keep it quiet.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.000
Want to touch me?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.080
Here's my price:

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.800
one hundred gold.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.830
Master, no, help!

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.870
Rogue, how dare you!

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.640
Gentleman,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.870
we can bargain,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.510
but I'm the dream guy
of countless ladies

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.600
in Hunling City.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.540
How could you punch me?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.480
How rough.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.870
She adores my peerless looks

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.920
and demands service;

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.830
one hundred gold

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.800
is fair.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.600
Why be mad about this?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.640
Jie...

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.190
Mr. Jie, this isn't right.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.430
Master...

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.390
I'm not your master.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.950
Why do you look like this?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.310
This is normal.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.480
Hong Zhua reincarnated,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.600
so his temperament changed,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.720
but his nature didn't.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.900
As an immortal,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.320
he thought only of the greater good;

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.670
as a mortal,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.860
he thinks only of money.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.360
My master is not like that!

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.480
Master...

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.440
Alright.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.710
Mr. Hong,

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.390
you must have noticed:

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.390
sky darkens by the day;

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.920
plants wither.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.720
The shard you carry

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.190
can save all living beings.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.920
All living beings?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.080
Miss,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.560
you're so kind.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.780
So, you agree?

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.470
- 2,000 taels.
- What?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.310
I was born with this jade;

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.950
it's been my companion

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.750
my whole life

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.630
and never left me.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.240
It's my primordial essence.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.870
This price

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.390
tests the sincerity

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.000
on behalf of all living beings.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.200
Mr. Hong,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.000
the world

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.360
truly needs it.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.430
In that case,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.870
for the world's sake,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.320
at least 1,000 taels.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.750
50% discount.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.670
Get out.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.480
You don't have money,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.250
yet you lecture me
about all living beings?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.120
This is crazy.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.360
A waste of time.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.240
Utterly speechless.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.270
Master, how did you become like this?

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.720
How could he do this?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.030
I told you we should tie him up,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.360
but you refused.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.510
Now what?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.340
The Artifact is broken;

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.200
the light over Hunling City

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.390
is only afterglow.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.840
We must obtain

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.390
the shard at once,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.150
or the sun will fade,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.230
and the city

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.120
will rot in Miasma

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.720
like the Demon Realm.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.320
Since Hong Baoyu scorns virtue

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.320
and worships money,

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.000
let's just give him money.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.990
Now,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080
only one trick will work:

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.600
turning stone to gold.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.200
(No spells are allowed.)

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.480
(Have you forgotten?)

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.150
(Don't worry.)

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.630
(This is the gentlest spell.)

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.240
(It's so mild.)

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.030
(It won't harm the city.)

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.360
(However,)

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.550
(it lasts only
half an incense stick of time.)

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.440
(Grab the shard and run.)

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.690
(Sure.)

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.690
(You can't do it again.)

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.750
Mr. Hong,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.440
is this enough?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.840
Yes.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.200
Hey.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.550
You promised us.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.350
No.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.510
Something's wrong.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.720
Yesterday, you were broke;

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.910
today, you're lugging gold.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.440
Suspicious.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.320
(He noticed?)

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.480
(Impossible.)

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.790
(He's a mortal.)

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.500
(How could he see through a spell?)

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.590
I get it!

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.080
You two...

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.510
You two

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.550
found a brilliant way

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.810
and got rich overnight.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.710
Share the secret.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.790
Tell me!

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.350
No.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.570
Hand over the Artifact.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.000
If you don't tell me,

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.270
I can't oblige.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.230
Wait.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.910
The shard is the priority.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.390
Endure it.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.390
Mr. Hong,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.630
we're pressed for time.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.750
Give us the shard today;

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.000
we'll explain next time.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.240
You look down on me, right?

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.870
I know

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.600
that in your eyes,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.360
- (Time's up.)
- I'm not qualified

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.910
to join your business,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.720
but I was born

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.790
to hardship.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.910
I can endure hardships;

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.550
also,

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.150
I'm very clever.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.710
Oh, no.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.080
What?

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.630
Don't move.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.800
100 taels.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.320
I have a bottom line.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.040
500 taels.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.440
Is that enough?

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.120
Sir, there are things

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.030
I can't do

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.320
for money.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.910
1,000 taels.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.030
How can you test me like this?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.510
Any...

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.510
Any more?

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.750
What are you doing?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.630
Listen.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.240
Listen to what?

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.280
Master,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.950
please accept me as your disciple.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.270
Master,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.910
I was narrow-sighted.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440
Nothing earns faster

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.030
than turning stone to gold!

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.240
Take it.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.200
Rise.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.000
Once the reincarnation is over,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.150
Master will be normal again, right?

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.670
If the Artifact can't be repaired,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.790
he can't reincarnate,

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.270
and you'll be free of longing.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.240
Are you jealous?

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.150
I rule both realms.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.120
The world comes first.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.710
Are you angry?

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.360
I was wrong.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.960
I can't fix the Artifact alone.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.150
The shard flickers on and off.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.870
We must first

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.240
activate the Artifact

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.750
to repair it.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.990
Help me.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.870
I'm helpful, right?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.390
(To repair the Artifact,)

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.260
(we must enter
the Dragon Ancestor's Illusion.)

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.980
(Dragon Ancestor's Illusion)

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.680
Jie Chuan.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.550
Who are you?

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.670
I am the Dragon Ancestor.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.150
You came for the Sun Artifact.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.390
Ten thousand years ago, I gave my eyes

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.710
to drive out the demonic barrier

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:27.960
and forged that Artifact.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.510
Now, it's been ruined by your conflict.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.000
This is fate.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.990
Today,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.000
I'm the sovereign of both;

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.200
immortals and demons live in peace.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.840
Since I've reached

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.200
this illusion,

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.600
a way to mend the Artifact

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.200
must exist.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.390
Please enlighten me.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.000
Do you think the conflict

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.600
ends so easily?

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.200
Ji Li is fated to slay you;

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.840
its edge is honed.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.630
If you cannot settle her,

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.960
how will you settle two worlds?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.440
Jie Chuan,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.790
if you don't kill Ji Li,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.870
you'll suffer the consequences.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.920
Ji Li.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.120
Are you hurt?

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.080
I've never bowed to fate.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.000
If she is fated to kill me,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.510
I will break that fate.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.360
How dare you defy fate?

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.600
In that case,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.790
let me help you.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.590
My life is mine alone,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.110
not fate's to command.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.780

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.740
