ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTIONAL

01:05.708 --> 01:08.333
I knew that junkie was trouble.
Detective Cha, grab him!

01:08.416 --> 01:09.625
- He put his mouth on it!
- What, now?

01:09.708 --> 01:12.875
- Asshole, why can't you just stay still?
- You bastard.

01:12.958 --> 01:15.458
- Let me drink some water!
- Come here, you punk.

01:15.541 --> 01:16.541
What a shit show.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.166
- Why won't you let me fucking drink?
- Careful! You'll slip!

01:25.458 --> 01:26.916
So who's the client?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.416
Oh Jae-cheol, the son
of Dongin Milling's chairman.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.875
<i>This prick asked for you
as soon as he got here.</i>

01:31.958 --> 01:34.166
You're going national. Congrats.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.708
Nice! I'm better than some random lawyer.

01:37.791 --> 01:39.458
So, has he got any priors?

01:39.541 --> 01:42.125
<i>Three for the same crime,
one year of probation left.</i>

01:42.208 --> 01:44.875
<i>Hey, Kang-su. We got him spooked
with possession for sale,</i>

01:44.958 --> 01:45.958
so put a pretty bow on it.

01:46.041 --> 01:49.500
Come on! Putting a bow on him
is hardly enough!

01:49.583 --> 01:51.333
We got a VIP on the hook.

01:51.416 --> 01:52.875
We need to dream big.

02:01.541 --> 02:03.125
You don't look like a dealer.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.708
How did you end up carrying around
as much as 500 g?

02:06.791 --> 02:09.125
Captain, how much is 500 g worth?

02:09.208 --> 02:10.333
About five years.

02:11.833 --> 02:13.125
That's long.

02:13.791 --> 02:14.833
Shut the hell up!

02:17.375 --> 02:18.708
Can you get me out?

02:20.083 --> 02:24.208
That depends on whether
you, me, and those guys

02:24.291 --> 02:26.625
are satisfied or not.

02:28.041 --> 02:29.666
Let's make it happen!

02:31.041 --> 02:32.458
Go big or go home!

02:34.708 --> 02:36.083
Okay!

02:36.166 --> 02:38.416
Three dealers or higher-up,
20 million each.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.666
Amount in kilos.

02:39.750 --> 02:40.916
How many kilos?

02:41.958 --> 02:43.791
Two kilos. 50 million won per kilo.

02:43.875 --> 02:46.958
So 100 million, 160 million in total
with the three heads.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.125
In Bitcoins.

02:51.375 --> 02:54.000
Buddy, got that?

02:54.791 --> 02:56.000
In Bitcoins.

02:58.416 --> 03:00.083
I'll leave the amount to you.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.125
Okay!

03:02.958 --> 03:06.541
Enough drugs for 66,000 users.
A major drug ring busted!

03:07.875 --> 03:09.250
You'll get the media coverage,

03:10.208 --> 03:12.375
and you'll get to go home.

03:22.208 --> 03:23.416
Okay.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.875
- Damn it!
- What the fuck, man?

03:29.958 --> 03:30.958
Hey!

03:31.666 --> 03:32.750
Back up!

03:35.125 --> 03:36.166
Move your car, man!

03:36.250 --> 03:37.416
Fucking hell...

03:39.000 --> 03:40.625
Move your car, dude!

03:42.541 --> 03:46.125
Chang-rak, you sure lack
some manners, don't you?

03:46.208 --> 03:47.458
You got out thanks to me.

03:47.541 --> 03:49.875
You could've given me a call
after you got released,

03:49.958 --> 03:52.083
but I guess that wasn't so easy, huh?

03:53.458 --> 03:56.125
Although you're doing
your business as usual.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.000
No, not this, dude!

03:59.083 --> 04:00.583
How much came in?

04:01.833 --> 04:03.083
Three kilos?

04:03.166 --> 04:04.166
Lose two, all right?

04:05.458 --> 04:09.125
Come on. How am I to get by
if I lose two-thirds of it?

04:09.708 --> 04:14.666
The world's longest-living junkies
are Korean junkies.

04:14.750 --> 04:15.750
Why do you think that is?

04:15.833 --> 04:18.916
Because the cops lock you up

04:19.000 --> 04:21.625
before you overdose.

04:21.708 --> 04:23.458
Want to go detox behind bars for a bit?

04:25.583 --> 04:28.666
Chang-rak, stop adding alum to the drugs!

04:28.750 --> 04:30.375
You can't be the drug king like this!

04:31.166 --> 04:33.625
Fine, what do you want?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.583
Get me three scapegoats.

04:35.666 --> 04:40.583
Not just users. I want
dealers, mules, and distributors.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.791
Wrap them up nicely.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.958
<i>If I don't get a call,
you'll be the first to go.</i>

04:46.166 --> 04:49.583
Why the hell isn't that asshole here yet?

04:49.666 --> 04:51.750
- Hey, here he is!
- Gosh, stay still!

04:52.958 --> 04:56.375
Here, check the goods.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.708
All good?

05:00.041 --> 05:01.291
Thank you.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.375
Take it out!

05:03.250 --> 05:05.500
Okay, that's 2 kg.

05:06.583 --> 05:08.083
- Go, let's go.
- Let's go, baby!

05:12.625 --> 05:14.333
Why the fuck did she back up?

05:14.416 --> 05:15.666
- What's her problem?
- I'm sorry!

05:15.750 --> 05:16.791
It hurts.

05:16.875 --> 05:20.208
Could you step out and check the damage?

05:20.958 --> 05:22.083
Hold up a sec!

05:22.833 --> 05:24.125
- What?
- Wait, don't get out.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.625
Why? What's up?

05:26.708 --> 05:27.875
Stay focused.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.791
Something feels off.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.916
Can you roll down the window?

05:37.041 --> 05:38.458
Dude, back up.

05:38.541 --> 05:39.625
Back up! Now!

05:39.708 --> 05:42.041
- Don't move!
- Stop them!

05:45.875 --> 05:48.208
- Break the window!
- Open the door, you pricks!

05:48.291 --> 05:49.666
Babe, the door!

05:49.750 --> 05:52.000
- Open the fucking door!
- Open up!

05:52.083 --> 05:54.083
- Floor it!
- Get us out of here!

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Get up there!

05:58.333 --> 05:59.916
- Open up!
- Open the damn door!

06:01.958 --> 06:04.166
Bro, I did my part.
You've got to cover my base costs.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.250
Got it?

06:11.625 --> 06:12.750
Open the fucking door!

06:13.958 --> 06:15.916
Sang-cheol, they're headed your way.
Block them!

06:20.083 --> 06:21.625
You sons of bitches!

06:21.708 --> 06:24.583
Jeez, what a bunch of fools.

06:26.916 --> 06:27.916
Open the door, asshole!

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
You fucking pigs!

06:35.500 --> 06:36.708
Go after them!

06:44.250 --> 06:45.416
Damn it!

06:50.583 --> 06:52.583
Still got one more hit left.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.916
Junkies won't listen.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.333
You've got to bulldoze them
to get them out.

07:07.791 --> 07:08.791
Guys!

07:08.875 --> 07:11.875
<i>Korea's drug scene is
divided into three groups.</i>

07:11.958 --> 07:15.375
<i>Those who deal, those who catch them,</i>

07:15.458 --> 07:19.666
<i>and their liaison, like me.</i>

07:20.708 --> 07:24.708
<i>I provide cases
involving arrested junkies to the police.</i>

07:25.333 --> 07:28.166
<i>These cases boost the cops' performance,</i>

07:28.250 --> 07:32.833
<i>which comes back to the junkies
as "Investigation Cooperation Agreement."</i>

07:35.750 --> 07:37.041
Here you go.

07:37.750 --> 07:38.875
<i>Investigation Cooperation Agreement.</i>

07:38.958 --> 07:40.041
There's your ticket out.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.875
<i>It can slash a ten-year sentence
down to just one-third.</i>

07:42.958 --> 07:44.208
Check if it's legit.

07:44.291 --> 07:48.083
<i>It's plea bargaining,
which only exists for drug crimes.</i>

07:49.125 --> 07:50.916
It came out nice and clean.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.041
DEPOSITED:
160 MILLION (1.75 BTC)

07:55.125 --> 07:56.541
You got the 160 million?

08:11.458 --> 08:17.500
<i>In short, all major drug busts are
neatly greased wheels in this system.</i>

08:17.583 --> 08:19.250
Can you get everything?

08:22.375 --> 08:25.708
I paid for it and I'll use them all,
so why do you fucking care?

08:25.791 --> 08:28.666
<i>The media has to create a buzz
for the police to look good,</i>

08:28.750 --> 08:32.833
<i>only then will the Investigation
Cooperation Agreement follow.</i>

08:32.916 --> 08:34.333
Kang-su, good work!

08:35.041 --> 08:36.041
Salute!

08:37.833 --> 08:40.916
<i>My life runs between the junkies
and the police across the country.</i>

08:42.083 --> 08:45.791
<i>In the drug scene,
people like me are called...</i>

08:56.000 --> 08:57.083
3 YEARS AGO

08:57.166 --> 08:58.791
So, how old are you?

08:58.875 --> 09:00.541
I'm 28, sir.

09:00.625 --> 09:02.458
Twenty-eight?

09:03.250 --> 09:04.583
Good.

09:04.666 --> 09:06.083
- You've got to...
- Jeez!

09:06.166 --> 09:09.166
- ...spend your time wisely, bud.
- Yes, sir.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.250
One tiny choice will make you

09:12.333 --> 09:15.750
either a rising star
or a washed-up failure.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.416
Here, rising star!

09:19.500 --> 09:20.916
But sir, it's too much...

09:22.000 --> 09:24.291
- Wait here for 30 minutes.
- Pardon?

09:24.375 --> 09:26.541
I'm going to go see
my side chick for a bit.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.875
- Here! Drink.
- Sure.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.250
Nice.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.625
I'll be right back.

09:53.208 --> 09:54.708
Holy shit...

10:21.916 --> 10:24.916
You're under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.166
It tickles.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.500
It tickles!

Farting is only allowed in the bathroom.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.583
Take off your shoes.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.208
Oh, dear...

10:49.458 --> 10:51.250
Go on, show him in.

10:54.416 --> 10:56.875
- It's heavy, huh? Let me help you.
- Thank you.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.291
- Jeez!
- What the hell?

11:03.375 --> 11:05.666
- Son of a bitch!
- I'm sorry!

11:05.750 --> 11:08.541
How dare you fart in here! You fucker!

Is it a Smurf day today?

11:23.208 --> 11:25.500
Hey, Papa Smurf, come here.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.125
Sit down.

11:30.125 --> 11:32.458
You goddamn junkies.
I told you not to sit here!

11:32.541 --> 11:35.541
<i>It wasn't until I became
one of them that I realized</i>

11:35.625 --> 11:39.125
<i>that my life had gone terribly off track.</i>

11:39.208 --> 11:43.375
<i>But even in a fucked-up life,
opportunities arise.</i>

11:45.833 --> 11:47.250
- Move closer!
- Sit down.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.625
Good afternoon!

11:52.125 --> 11:54.208
Could you take some off the top?

11:54.708 --> 11:58.791
<i>Prosecutor Gu was just another prosecutor

11:58.875 --> 12:00.375
<i>On his tenth year,</i>

12:00.458 --> 12:05.458
<i>he was exiled to Northern District,
where he handled drug offenders.</i>

12:06.375 --> 12:08.958
<i>There are 2,500 prosecutors in Korea.</i>

<i>The remaining 99%

<i>But Gu had no intention
of resigning from his post.</i>

12:21.916 --> 12:26.500
<i>He began creating his own opportunities

Get the bug spray!

<i>Look at me properly.</i>

12:57.916 --> 12:59.375
Brush your hair aside.

13:05.791 --> 13:07.708
Yeah, you don't have the look of a junkie.

13:07.791 --> 13:10.250
- No, sir.
- Looks like you've been framed.

13:10.333 --> 13:13.500
You had a drink he gave you
and blacked out?

13:13.583 --> 13:15.000
- No doubt about it.
- Yes!

13:15.083 --> 13:16.750
That's right!

13:16.833 --> 13:19.208
He used you because he thought
he was going to get caught.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.041
That's exactly it, Prosecutor!

13:21.791 --> 13:23.875
Are you good at memorizing things?

13:23.958 --> 13:25.041
Pardon?

13:29.083 --> 13:30.375
Recite from memory.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.625
I don't know about this stuff.

You'll have to know everything here.

14:02.916 --> 14:05.666
And I need to be informed

<i>To do that, what do you need to do?</i>

14:34.083 --> 14:35.166
Hey!

14:36.250 --> 14:37.458
Boss!

14:37.541 --> 14:39.666
- Let go of me, you bastard!
- What's your problem?

14:40.416 --> 14:41.416
Hey!

14:42.166 --> 14:43.333
You son of a bitch!

14:43.416 --> 14:44.541
Hey!

14:45.000 --> 14:46.416
Prick!

14:49.458 --> 14:50.500
Give it to him.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.458
Eat slowly.

15:03.416 --> 15:04.416
Sir,

15:05.791 --> 15:07.291
can I ask you for a favor?

15:07.375 --> 15:08.500
What is it?

15:08.583 --> 15:09.625
Hey!

15:11.458 --> 15:12.458
You fucker!

15:13.250 --> 15:15.500
You bastard! Let go!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.291
Get him off!

15:19.291 --> 15:20.833
Get off me, you pest!

15:20.916 --> 15:22.291
Let go!

15:25.916 --> 15:28.041
Freeze! Nobody move!

15:29.458 --> 15:31.708
Hey, wait! What's this?

15:34.208 --> 15:35.541
You dared to bring drugs in here?

15:35.625 --> 15:38.250
- Son of a bitch!
- That's not mine. It's not!

15:38.333 --> 15:39.583
It's not mine!

15:39.666 --> 15:42.250
That's enough. Cut it out.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.458
Oh, dear.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.250
Two packages of goods just came in.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.833
Should we send them
to Pyeongtaek and Incheon?

15:54.625 --> 15:57.375
Send Myeong-cheon
for the Pyeongtaek package,

15:57.458 --> 15:58.958
and for the Incheon package,

15:59.041 --> 16:01.541
send Jeong-yeop to get a sample first.

16:01.625 --> 16:02.833
Prosecutor Gu.

16:02.916 --> 16:04.166
Thank you.

16:04.666 --> 16:06.875
Good job. Nice.

16:06.958 --> 16:07.958
Come here.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.166
If you leave it like this, it'll scar.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.916
The other side. Your lips.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.375
All done.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.416
<i>I'm Prosecutor Gu Kwan-hui
of Criminal Division Two.</i>

16:24.500 --> 16:28.833
<i>Based on the testimony
of a subordinate of Ko Heung-sik,</i>

16:28.916 --> 16:31.208
<i>a major drug ring leader
held at Uijeongbu Detention Center...</i>

16:31.291 --> 16:33.125
What the hell is he saying?

16:34.041 --> 16:35.666
Where the hell is the bastard Lee Kang-su?

16:35.750 --> 16:36.916
Freeze! Don't move!

16:37.541 --> 16:38.541
Lee Kang-su!

16:42.166 --> 16:47.458
TRANSFERRED TO
GWANGJU DETENTION CENTER

16:47.958 --> 16:50.125
- Good morning!
- Morning, sir.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.750
GWANGJU DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

16:53.958 --> 16:57.708
PROMOTED TO
DEPUTY DIVISION CHIEF PROSECUTOR

16:58.458 --> 17:00.333
<i>I'm in Bangkok, Thailand!</i>

17:00.833 --> 17:03.708
I came here to learn some skills.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.750
Beef?

17:09.250 --> 17:10.375
What do you mean?

17:11.250 --> 17:12.750
A beef gift set under my name?

17:16.875 --> 17:19.208
It's no big deal.
Let me know if you want more.

17:19.291 --> 17:20.416
I have to go.

17:21.750 --> 17:26.000
Come on, you didn't have to do that.
But thank you, sir.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.291
Your mom works alone in the orchard,
she needs to eat well.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.250
Didn't you tell her you're in prison?

17:31.458 --> 17:33.833
If my mom finds out, she'll collapse.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.500
You're a good son.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.291
I don't know.
What kind of good son serves in prison?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.416
My mom raised me alone too.

17:44.500 --> 17:49.125
She'd head to the market
to sell fish before dawn,

17:49.625 --> 17:54.250
and then wash dishes all day
at a restaurant. Jeez.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.208
She did all that for her son.

17:57.291 --> 18:02.750
She'd always say,
"Don't let other people look down on you."

18:02.833 --> 18:06.125
"Be successful, no matter what.
Just be successful."

18:06.791 --> 18:08.583
It's burned into my ears.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.208
Here.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.166
Drink up.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.708
Drink.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.166
It's fine, I'll take care of it.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.333
No need to worry. It's okay to drink.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.875
I'm getting transferred
to the Western District.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.208
- You're finally entering Seoul?
- It's technically Seoul,

18:40.291 --> 18:43.250
but it's the one that handles
the most mediocre cases out of the four.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.916
I'll aim for
the Eastern District next time,

18:46.541 --> 18:49.500
then the Special Investigation Unit
at the Central Prosecutors' Office.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.333
What will you do when you get out?

18:52.916 --> 18:54.791
Me?

18:55.541 --> 18:57.166
Well, I...

18:57.666 --> 18:59.208
I'm not sure.

18:59.291 --> 19:02.916
If I were a real junkie,
I'd celebrate with a big hit.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.166
Cut it out!

19:05.291 --> 19:06.916
I'm just kidding.

19:07.708 --> 19:08.916
Kang-su, listen.

19:10.083 --> 19:13.000
Why don't you
become a professional snitch?

19:13.083 --> 19:15.958
You'll never have to
worry about making a living.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.333
And you can help your bro out too.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.083
Are you laughing?

19:23.166 --> 19:24.875
It's just a bit awkward

19:26.250 --> 19:28.958
to hear you suddenly say "bro."

19:30.458 --> 19:34.041
From now on, consider me
your brother. All right?

19:34.625 --> 19:35.625
Sure.

19:36.708 --> 19:40.000
If I can help you, I'll do it.

19:40.083 --> 19:44.250
Not as a junkie and a prosecutor,

19:45.583 --> 19:47.625
but as two real brothers.

19:48.875 --> 19:51.166
All right, you're my brother now.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.583
Brother! Let me pour you a drink!

20:04.208 --> 20:07.500
Hey, promise me one thing.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.833
Don't even lay your finger on drugs.

20:12.541 --> 20:13.958
I'm saying this as your big brother.

20:15.291 --> 20:19.791
The moment you stick a needle
in your arm, your life is over.

20:22.875 --> 20:23.875
Sure.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.458
Shit, it's raining.

20:25.541 --> 20:26.583
3 YEARS LATER, PRESENT DAY

20:26.666 --> 20:28.583
- How far up are we going?
<i>- Captain, over here.</i>

20:30.041 --> 20:31.291
Evening, sir!

20:32.208 --> 20:34.375
They've been like this for three hours.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.500
They won't respond no matter what I say.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.208
- Get in here!
- Yes, sir!

20:38.291 --> 20:40.875
- What are you getting all wet for?
- Sorry, sir.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.916
- Hold it!
- It's driving me crazy, jeez.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.750
- They won't listen!
- Open the door already.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.625
Miss, open up!

20:49.958 --> 20:54.666
You have the right to an attorney
and to remain silent!

20:55.250 --> 20:59.125
No response. I'll handle it my way!

20:59.208 --> 21:01.000
Cops are here. Things got serious!

21:01.083 --> 21:02.333
You have to do something.

21:02.416 --> 21:03.750
Sir, the tow truck is here.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.708
Please take care of it right away!

21:13.875 --> 21:14.875
Get going!

21:14.958 --> 21:18.041
- Wait, please wait...
- They're towing our car!

21:18.125 --> 21:20.708
What do I do?

21:20.791 --> 21:23.083
- It's positive.
- She's too young for this kind of shit.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.875
I was just told...

21:26.875 --> 21:29.958
it was a pill for weight loss.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.750
I'm preparing for a movie.

21:34.333 --> 21:35.916
I didn't know it was bad.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.291
Here we go again, the same old excuse.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.875
I've heard all that already.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.500
It's Eom Su-jin, you know?

21:45.208 --> 21:46.625
Who gave you the weight loss pills?

21:48.166 --> 21:51.500
If you stay silent,
I won't be able to help you.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.916
- Wait, I know that guy.
- You do?

21:56.666 --> 21:59.166
He was charged for drug use
two years ago and got probation.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.750
- Yeah, him...
- His name is...

22:00.833 --> 22:02.458
Yoo something, Yoo...

22:02.541 --> 22:03.916
Yeah, something like that.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.208
What's his name?

22:11.250 --> 22:13.958
Yoo Min-gu... Yoo Se-yeong...

22:14.750 --> 22:17.000
Got it. Yoo Ji-seong.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.375
Yoo Ji-seong?

22:18.958 --> 22:20.416
Ilmun Construction chairman's son, right?

22:21.125 --> 22:22.916
Yes, you're right!

22:24.666 --> 22:28.125
You don't know my name, do you?

22:30.125 --> 22:32.583
Captain Oh Sang-jae, Narcotics Unit Two.

22:32.666 --> 22:34.625
But the junkies call me "Jade Emperor."

22:35.291 --> 22:37.000
Because once I catch you,
I bury you in charges

22:37.083 --> 22:39.291
and lock you up for life.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.541
Should I make the call?

22:41.625 --> 22:44.125
One call, and the reporters
will swarm in like vultures.

22:44.208 --> 22:46.958
Want me to drag you to stand
in front of the reporters?

22:52.041 --> 22:53.666
- Uncuff her.
- Sure.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.375
Your head must be spinning.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.416
Wondering who you can talk about
and who you can't.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.208
Don't overthink it.

23:04.291 --> 23:07.416
Whoever we catch, they'll rat you out.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.583
"Eom Su-jin! The actress!"

23:09.666 --> 23:11.291
If it gets to that point,

23:11.375 --> 23:14.500
then I won't be able to help you out!

23:15.833 --> 23:18.041
You know what I do
with people like you, Su-jin?

23:20.916 --> 23:24.250
If they just tell the truth,
I let them go home.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.708
Instead, I catch the dealer
and fuck him up.

23:26.791 --> 23:30.041
Even if I catch 100 users,
there will be 100 more the next day.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.833
It's a matter of time
until those 100 turn into 200, then 400.

23:32.916 --> 23:35.041
Where does it all start from?

23:35.541 --> 23:37.916
The dealer who supplies the drugs.

23:39.458 --> 23:40.833
So tell me.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.250
Who gave you the drugs?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.500
SEOUL EASTERN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

24:09.000 --> 24:10.333
Prosecutor.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.541
Prosecutor.

24:12.458 --> 24:14.583
Chief Prosecutor!

24:14.666 --> 24:16.541
Kang-su! Come here.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.250
This isn't it?

24:19.333 --> 24:21.041
CHIEF PROSECUTOR, GU KWAN-HUI

24:22.041 --> 24:27.166
<i>For next year's presidential election...</i>

24:27.250 --> 24:29.208
Bro, what is this place?

24:29.291 --> 24:30.916
It's called an attached office.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.083
Not just anyone can come in here.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.625
This is where we investigate VIPs

24:35.708 --> 24:38.083
like conglomerate chairmen
and former presidents.

24:38.166 --> 24:42.083
We grill them in the interrogation room
and then baby them here unofficially.

24:42.750 --> 24:46.583
This place is not for regular folks.
You're in the VIP room.

24:47.875 --> 24:51.291
I'm a VIP, right? Unofficial VIP.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.583
Wow.

24:56.666 --> 25:00.166
You definitely have to climb high.

25:02.791 --> 25:05.208
And look down at the entire view.

25:05.291 --> 25:07.333
It sure feels empowering.

25:07.416 --> 25:08.416
Does it feel good?

25:11.875 --> 25:13.000
Kang-su.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.750
Sometimes, when I look out,

25:16.708 --> 25:21.166
I feel like I'm dangling off the edge
of this railing, about to drop.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.583
I get so darn nervous.

25:24.708 --> 25:26.166
Shit!

25:26.250 --> 25:28.000
If you fall from here,
you'll be damn screwed.

25:28.083 --> 25:32.708
That's why I'm holding on
for my dear life!

25:32.791 --> 25:34.875
So, you have to do well, you punk.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.125
Right.

25:40.208 --> 25:42.791
You know what I mean?
We all need to do well.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.708
Come on, man.

25:48.791 --> 25:50.875
Why worry about stuff like that?

25:50.958 --> 25:52.958
Bro, just keep looking up.

25:53.041 --> 25:54.708
I'll give you my full support.

25:56.125 --> 25:58.625
All right, I'm counting on you.

25:59.541 --> 26:02.125
Since I've come this far, let's aim
for the Special Investigation Unit.

26:03.833 --> 26:04.875
Dude!

26:04.958 --> 26:06.875
Now that's some confidence!

26:09.125 --> 26:10.416
One sec.

26:17.083 --> 26:20.291
This isn't anything special.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.666
Open it.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.500
A lighter?

26:27.041 --> 26:30.166
Bro, if you're going all the way
to the Central District SIU,

26:30.250 --> 26:33.000
you need to smoke
your cigarettes in style!

26:33.083 --> 26:37.250
Use this until retirement.

26:37.333 --> 26:38.666
Stay in style, okay?

26:40.708 --> 26:41.958
Okay, thanks.

26:42.041 --> 26:44.875
And this one's for myself.

26:46.916 --> 26:49.541
What, it's a matching set?

26:54.166 --> 26:55.208
What's that?

26:55.291 --> 26:57.125
This stuff is called "Blue."

26:57.208 --> 26:59.333
It's only available to the real big shots.

26:59.416 --> 27:01.916
100% pure North Korean meth.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.666
Low-level junkies
can't even dream of this stuff.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.791
The price is insane. Oh, man...

27:08.916 --> 27:10.708
Come on, tell me, what's the deal?

27:10.791 --> 27:12.291
- The thing is...
- Yeah?

27:12.375 --> 27:17.208
...a guy was caught with 500 g
of this stuff last week.

27:17.958 --> 27:21.291
I brokered a deal
with the police on his behalf.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.500
His name is Oh Jae-cheol.

27:24.458 --> 27:25.750
<i>The Dongin Milling heir.</i>

27:29.625 --> 27:31.833
I smell a hint of something baking.

27:31.916 --> 27:35.416
Bro, this isn't baking.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.583
It's gasoline leaking everywhere
at the gas station!

27:39.250 --> 27:40.541
If you just

27:41.333 --> 27:43.041
light it...

27:43.125 --> 27:44.583
Kaboom!

27:44.666 --> 27:47.250
You'll get to Central District SIU,

27:48.125 --> 27:49.750
and I'll go national.

27:50.958 --> 27:53.166
So who's the guy
spilling all this gasoline?

27:54.291 --> 27:55.291
Yeom...

27:55.375 --> 28:01.125
Mr. Yeom, but I don't know his full name.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.000
Daegu gangster Yeom Tae-su?

28:04.791 --> 28:06.875
- Got Gyeongsang-do dialect.
- Yes.

28:15.500 --> 28:19.916
Exactly 4.5 kg.
500 g melted in her stomach.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.583
- Ma'am.
- What is it?

28:24.333 --> 28:26.125
Let's go bigger.

28:26.208 --> 28:28.125
Stop using mules with condoms.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.833
You've learned to be picky, haven't you?

28:33.708 --> 28:35.625
Then you can do it yourself.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.875
Stuff condoms into your stomach.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.541
You bastard!

28:41.250 --> 28:42.458
Boss!

28:44.875 --> 28:46.041
Sons of bitches!

28:46.125 --> 28:47.125
Put that down!

28:49.375 --> 28:50.375
Fat fuck.

28:50.458 --> 28:52.791
Should I continue?

28:55.166 --> 28:56.333
Fucking hell.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.875
Call that even for the missing 500 g

28:59.958 --> 29:02.000
with his medical bills.

29:10.958 --> 29:15.458
Did you see Kim Hak-nam flinch,
trying to keep a straight face?

29:15.541 --> 29:17.375
Should we take her out one of these days?

29:18.166 --> 29:20.291
Her boys won't sit back and watch, though.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.500
We've got to put her behind bars
like her brothers,

29:22.583 --> 29:25.041
so that we can deal Yamamoto's goods.

29:27.083 --> 29:29.833
<i>Boss, we'll block them up front.</i>

29:29.916 --> 29:31.083
<i>Just hit them.</i>

29:32.291 --> 29:33.958
Let's hit when they reach
Namdong complex.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.125
Stay on their tail.

29:41.791 --> 29:45.750
<i>Mr. Yeom Tae-su!
Seems like you've lost your edge!</i>

29:45.833 --> 29:47.791
<i>You got pigs lined up behind you.</i>

29:49.166 --> 29:50.500
Isn't that Jade Emperor?

29:52.916 --> 29:55.416
- What the hell?
- There's no time to look back!

29:55.500 --> 29:58.208
<i>Get out of here. I'll cover you!</i>

29:59.041 --> 30:00.625
- Turn the car around!
- Damn it!

30:06.541 --> 30:07.625
Fucking hell!

30:08.333 --> 30:09.583
Get out of the way!

30:10.083 --> 30:12.083
- Who are you?
- I'm Yamamoto's man!

30:12.666 --> 30:13.666
Yamamoto?

30:13.750 --> 30:15.208
That son of a bitch!

30:20.375 --> 30:21.458
You punk!

30:22.208 --> 30:24.333
No time for chitchat,
get to Namdong Station!

30:24.416 --> 30:25.666
Hurry!

30:25.750 --> 30:27.500
- Go to Namdong Station!
- Shit!

30:31.708 --> 30:33.416
Look up 15RU8649!

30:36.208 --> 30:37.666
You son of a bitch!

30:45.750 --> 30:46.958
Yeom Tae-su is pulling over!

30:48.083 --> 30:49.416
He's stopping at Namdong Station!

30:49.500 --> 30:50.666
- Don't get caught.
- Yes, sir!

30:51.250 --> 30:52.291
Get going!

30:53.250 --> 30:54.458
Out of my way!

30:58.583 --> 31:00.500
- Which way?
- Inside Namdong station!

31:01.583 --> 31:03.125
What's your deal?

31:03.208 --> 31:04.750
We can greet each other in person later,

31:04.833 --> 31:07.541
<i>head to platform 3, gate 4-2,</i>

31:07.625 --> 31:09.625
your guardian angel is there.

31:09.708 --> 31:10.916
I'll see you there.

31:11.416 --> 31:13.541
Are you running? Run!

31:13.625 --> 31:15.166
<i>One, two!</i>

31:15.250 --> 31:16.958
- Request backup!
- Take the other side!

31:17.041 --> 31:18.291
Go to the back!

31:20.208 --> 31:21.791
Gate 4-2.

31:25.625 --> 31:26.958
Move!

31:27.041 --> 31:28.250
Yeom Tae-su!

31:29.958 --> 31:31.166
Yeom Tae-su!

31:31.833 --> 31:33.333
Out of the way! Police!

31:33.416 --> 31:34.708
- Make way!
- Be careful!

31:34.791 --> 31:36.666
- We're the police!
- Police!

31:38.625 --> 31:39.625
Back up, it's dangerous!

31:43.583 --> 31:44.791
Put it down!

31:44.875 --> 31:47.708
- Put it down, Yeom Tae-su!
- Come at me!

31:47.791 --> 31:49.500
Get it together, Yeom Tae-su!

31:55.666 --> 31:57.291
Stop acting up and put that down!

31:58.333 --> 32:00.000
Out of the way! Now!

32:04.833 --> 32:05.833
<i>Going up.</i>

32:07.875 --> 32:09.416
<i>Doors closing.</i>

32:10.375 --> 32:11.791
Yeom Tae-su, put it down!

32:11.875 --> 32:13.833
<i>Screen doors are opening.</i>

32:13.916 --> 32:15.250
Mr. Yeom Tae-su?

32:15.916 --> 32:16.916
Yeah, you're him.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.791
- What the hell?
- Get him!

32:25.916 --> 32:28.458
We're from the Prosecutors' Office!

32:28.541 --> 32:30.333
Prosecutors' Office.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.125
- You're a prosecutor?
- Yes.

32:34.333 --> 32:37.500
What gives you the right
to snatch away my suspect?

32:37.583 --> 32:40.916
There seems to be some misunderstanding.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.833
We've been staking this guy out for days!

32:44.916 --> 32:46.541
Thank you for your hard work.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.500
We have a warrant, see?

32:48.583 --> 32:49.625
Let's go.

32:49.708 --> 32:54.791
Is this some kind of joke?
What's going on?

32:54.875 --> 32:55.875
Bro!

32:55.958 --> 32:58.500
Hey, isn't that the guy
we saw in the car?

32:58.583 --> 32:59.625
Yes, that's him!

32:59.708 --> 33:03.166
His name is Lee Kang-su.
He's on the rise as a snitch lately.

33:03.958 --> 33:06.833
These guys are trying to steal my case.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.791
Hi. I told you
we'd greet each other in person.

33:15.875 --> 33:18.000
Are you the one who snitched on me?

33:18.083 --> 33:20.208
You already know the answer, so why ask?

33:21.833 --> 33:24.666
You've been keeping busy outside.

33:26.291 --> 33:28.250
Take some rest behind bars.

33:28.333 --> 33:29.916
- Think of it as vacation.
- Sir.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.208
How many years will you ask for?
Five years?

33:33.291 --> 33:34.375
No.

33:34.958 --> 33:38.791
Smuggling, illegal trade,
usage, and possession.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.375
Those are at least seven years.

33:41.291 --> 33:45.291
If I wanted to,
I could push for up to 15 years.

33:48.250 --> 33:49.458
That's long.

33:50.083 --> 33:53.708
So, how about we
wrap this up officially here?

33:54.708 --> 33:58.083
Or should we have
an unofficial, private conversation?

33:58.166 --> 33:59.208
INVESTIGATION
COOPERATION AGREEMENT

33:59.291 --> 34:01.708
Let's smoke a cigarette and sign, okay?

34:21.958 --> 34:23.958
OH SANG-JAE

34:27.041 --> 34:28.375
<i>Here's an idea.</i>

34:28.458 --> 34:30.458
Why don't you take the lead?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.041
Take the lead?

34:33.125 --> 34:36.416
When you meet anyone here,
just give me a call.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.708
They'll never know.

34:37.791 --> 34:40.000
You won't get into any trouble.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.375
You can trust me on that.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.041
Where are you?

34:51.125 --> 34:53.000
<i>I'll really be safe, right?</i>

34:53.083 --> 34:55.416
<i>Just tell me the location, and slip out.</i>

34:55.500 --> 34:56.833
Laura Hill Hotel.

34:56.916 --> 34:59.250
Laura Hill Hotel! Move!

35:00.208 --> 35:01.833
Stay sharp and stay focused!

35:17.875 --> 35:19.916
Where are you going? Let's head inside.

35:22.458 --> 35:27.416
I'm suddenly not feeling well,
so I think I'll go home and rest.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.500
Hey.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.125
See that geezer in blue?

35:31.208 --> 35:34.458
That guy helps my father out a lot.

35:34.541 --> 35:36.708
And gee, he really wants to meet you.

35:41.458 --> 35:45.291
Come on, I'm really not well today.
Next time--

35:45.375 --> 35:48.458
Hey, Su-jin. Eom Su-jin.

35:48.541 --> 35:51.541
You're not allowed to be sick
as you please. Got it?

35:57.041 --> 35:59.625
You cute thing. Nice acting, huh?

35:59.708 --> 36:01.708
You could be the female lead now.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.500
So pretty.

36:10.791 --> 36:13.125
How about now?
You wanna come along, right?

36:20.916 --> 36:23.875
All right, Laura Hill Hotel.

36:23.958 --> 36:26.500
We're here. Get out.

36:26.583 --> 36:28.333
If I see you again,
you're as good as dead.

36:28.416 --> 36:29.458
Got that?

36:29.541 --> 36:32.125
You'll need to wait in line for that.

36:32.208 --> 36:35.166
But I'm not sure
if your turn will come in time.

36:38.916 --> 36:40.791
You're 236th in line.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.750
Safety first. Be careful out there.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.708
- Let's get ready.
- Yes, sir!

36:46.791 --> 36:48.291
- Let's move!
- Hurry!

36:49.333 --> 36:50.791
Sir.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.750
I'll take my leave now.

36:52.833 --> 36:55.041
All right, good work. I'll see you around.

37:06.416 --> 37:08.416
- Hey!
- Yes, bro!

37:08.500 --> 37:10.083
If you're ready, let's head in!

37:11.166 --> 37:12.541
Okay, let's go!

37:37.791 --> 37:40.250
Let these people party here!

37:40.333 --> 37:42.541
And we can have fun on our own.

37:42.625 --> 37:43.750
How much?

37:43.833 --> 37:46.250
- A ton!
- A ton!

37:46.333 --> 37:48.333
Okay, go and have fun.

38:01.375 --> 38:02.791
So beautiful.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.625
- You again.
- I was about to call you.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.250
Care for a hit?

38:38.708 --> 38:40.208
It's a shit show.

38:42.666 --> 38:44.875
Hey, take pictures and get evidence.

38:44.958 --> 38:45.958
You're under arrest

38:46.041 --> 38:47.750
- for violating the Narcotics Control Act...
- What's up?

38:47.833 --> 38:51.666
- Call an ambulance for her!
- Call 911!

38:59.250 --> 39:00.458
What the fuck?

39:01.125 --> 39:02.333
Let's get a move on.

39:02.958 --> 39:05.000
- Move!
- What the fuck, man?

39:06.375 --> 39:07.750
Hey, Dad.

39:07.833 --> 39:10.666
How do I know where they're from?

39:12.041 --> 39:15.375
But can they really
barge in like this? I--

39:16.333 --> 39:17.750
Who are you guys?

39:17.833 --> 39:19.666
So you're the boss around here, huh?

39:19.750 --> 39:21.333
A handsome fellow.

39:21.416 --> 39:24.083
How about we get you on TV?

39:36.125 --> 39:37.583
They're already bringing them out.

39:38.083 --> 39:40.291
Damn it, what is this shit every time?

39:40.375 --> 39:41.541
It's those Eastern District guys again.

39:41.625 --> 39:43.166
We've got to make a living too!

39:43.250 --> 39:45.041
What's going on?

39:45.833 --> 39:48.166
- You got a warrant?
- Always going on about warrants!

39:48.250 --> 39:50.875
We can lock you all up
for obstruction of public duty!

39:50.958 --> 39:52.875
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:53.375 --> 39:55.625
She's an informant--

39:55.708 --> 39:57.708
- Captain, please don't.
- Get your hands off me!

39:57.791 --> 39:59.958
Captain, please calm down.
You can't tell them that!

40:00.833 --> 40:01.958
Detective...

40:03.666 --> 40:04.958
Detective.

40:15.666 --> 40:18.250
You'd better step aside here.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.458
These bears just had to be
so quick to catch onto things.

40:21.541 --> 40:23.375
Give me a call so we can grab a drink.

40:23.458 --> 40:25.916
- Sure thing.
- Make sure to call me this time.

40:26.541 --> 40:28.125
Prosecutor, sir!

40:29.750 --> 40:32.708
You seriously can't conduct
your investigation like this!

40:32.791 --> 40:34.125
Let me go!

40:34.750 --> 40:36.791
- Sang-cheol, just start the car.
- Prosecutor!

40:39.000 --> 40:41.125
- Hold on!
- It's dangerous! Get back!

40:45.833 --> 40:46.875
Hey there!

40:47.541 --> 40:48.541
Great work!

40:48.625 --> 40:51.541
But don't overdo it.
It doesn't mean much anyway.

40:54.666 --> 40:55.666
Stop the car!

40:56.166 --> 40:57.458
- Let go of me!
- No, sir!

40:57.541 --> 40:59.041
Get back here!

41:05.125 --> 41:07.083
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KIM MYEONG-HAK

41:12.000 --> 41:15.208
Causing a ruckus won't do you any good.

41:16.416 --> 41:20.000
I just made one call to keep things quiet.

41:20.083 --> 41:21.166
15 MISSED CALLS

41:21.250 --> 41:25.541
I really didn't know
it would reach Chief Prosecutor Kim.

41:25.625 --> 41:29.208
Because of your call,
my phone's been ringing off the hook.

41:30.125 --> 41:32.166
You must think I'm an easy target.

41:32.250 --> 41:36.250
Come on now. I wouldn't have come
in person if I thought that.

41:36.333 --> 41:37.750
Why are you here?

41:37.833 --> 41:39.708
Let's be honest here.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.250
You want to move up, right?

41:46.875 --> 41:49.750
If you handle this matter properly,

41:49.833 --> 41:53.791
Candidate Cho won't just line
his own pockets.

41:55.875 --> 42:00.500
Build this connection,
help him out a bit, and...

42:03.000 --> 42:04.833
things will turn out even better for you.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.500
Sir.

42:31.375 --> 42:36.250
<i>Nothing happened at Laura Hill Hotel.</i>

42:36.333 --> 42:37.333
Then...

42:38.666 --> 42:40.000
should I kill him?

42:42.416 --> 42:44.708
You've got to watch what you say.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.791
<i>...additional charges may be applied.</i>

42:47.875 --> 42:51.166
Bro, why aren't you picking up?
I'm on my way to the bar.

42:51.666 --> 42:53.875
Just wrap things up
and come over, okay?

42:53.958 --> 42:55.833
I know you got nothing to do.

42:55.916 --> 42:57.666
Don't your underlings do all the work?

42:59.625 --> 43:01.458
That was easier than hitting a deer.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.875
We're from
the Eastern Prosecutors' Office.

43:07.958 --> 43:09.416
- Why are you here?
- Please sit down.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.500
- Captain, why are these people here?
- We have a search warrant.

43:12.583 --> 43:14.708
- What's up? Why are you here?
- Hands off.

43:14.791 --> 43:16.458
Yeom Tae-su testified

43:16.541 --> 43:20.125
that you took bribes from him
in the course of the drug investigation.

43:26.583 --> 43:28.458
Kang-su.

43:29.166 --> 43:30.541
Hey, Kang-su.

43:31.208 --> 43:32.666
I came to give you a drink.

43:32.750 --> 43:34.541
Don't touch me, asshole!

43:34.625 --> 43:36.708
The veins pop out better
when you tense up.

43:36.791 --> 43:39.791
Don't! No!

43:40.791 --> 43:41.875
No! Don't!

43:41.958 --> 43:44.083
Here it comes!

43:44.666 --> 43:50.250
<i>Rising star actress Eom Su-jin
has been arrested on drug charges.</i>

43:50.333 --> 43:54.333
<i>Eom is accused of using
methamphetamine at a hotel in Seoul,</i>

43:54.416 --> 43:56.541
<i>and was detained today.</i>

43:57.708 --> 43:59.000
- Kyeok-hyeon.
- Yes, boss.

43:59.916 --> 44:02.375
- Make a copy of this.
- Sure.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.125
Oh, dear.

44:08.041 --> 44:09.791
My turn came up fast.

44:11.083 --> 44:12.875
I told you I'd kill you
if I ever saw you again.

44:12.958 --> 44:16.458
Kang-su, you son of a bitch.

44:16.541 --> 44:17.958
Get up, man!

44:18.583 --> 44:20.000
Please, don't...

44:20.583 --> 44:23.458
I'm sorry...

44:23.541 --> 44:24.791
Sorr--

44:40.541 --> 44:43.375
I'm sorry...

44:43.458 --> 44:45.625
You're totally screwed now.

44:51.541 --> 44:52.958
That gasoline stinks.

45:06.333 --> 45:09.958
No food. Keep him on meth
for a month, then toss him.

45:17.041 --> 45:18.833
Welcome, let me show you inside!

45:18.916 --> 45:19.916
3 MONTHS LATER

45:20.000 --> 45:21.958
- Welcome!
- Hi!

45:22.041 --> 45:24.458
- Salute! Right this way, please.
- Salute!

45:24.541 --> 45:28.583
Enough, your attitude is all wrong!

45:29.083 --> 45:31.416
You think an addict
realizes he's addicted?

45:31.958 --> 45:32.958
Chang-rak!

45:33.041 --> 45:35.375
That guy is screaming again.

45:35.458 --> 45:36.916
- Damn it...
- Check it out.

45:38.791 --> 45:42.791
Quitting meth is harder than getting it,
you dumbass.

45:43.541 --> 45:44.916
I've got to go.

45:48.166 --> 45:50.916
RESTRICTED AREA

45:52.958 --> 45:54.291
Fucking hell, seriously.

46:04.833 --> 46:07.125
You thought quitting meth was easy?

46:13.416 --> 46:14.541
Chang-rak...

46:17.958 --> 46:20.083
One hit, please!

46:20.916 --> 46:22.625
Just one hit.

46:23.833 --> 46:24.916
You son of a bitch!

46:25.000 --> 46:26.666
- Open this gate!
- What the fuck!

46:27.250 --> 46:30.416
One hit. Just one hit!

46:31.708 --> 46:32.833
You didn't eat again?

46:33.625 --> 46:35.416
You said you wanted to quit!

46:36.291 --> 46:39.083
Food tastes like sand, right?

46:40.541 --> 46:43.583
But you need to eat
to start feeling better!

46:51.625 --> 46:56.791
<i>When you're trying to quit drugs,
you see roaches, spiders, and shit.</i>

47:46.041 --> 47:47.666
Take a hit.

48:10.875 --> 48:12.000
Goddamn you!

48:41.708 --> 48:43.083
2938.

48:43.708 --> 48:45.041
1104.

48:45.125 --> 48:46.625
AND 7 MONTHS LATER

48:47.416 --> 48:50.166
<i>If you check the location data
from my phone,</i>

48:50.250 --> 48:54.333
<i>you'll see that I never met Yeom Tae-su,
who allegedly bribed me.</i>

48:54.916 --> 49:00.416
<i>Finally, a question for the prosecutor
who's kept me here for a year.</i>

49:00.500 --> 49:05.166
Can I investigate and arrest you
based solely on a claim

49:06.000 --> 49:10.208
made by a criminal
with eight drug convictions?

49:10.750 --> 49:12.000
<i>I will now announce the verdict.</i>

49:12.083 --> 49:15.250
The defendant, Oh Sang-jae, is acquitted.

49:17.750 --> 49:19.208
See you at the Supreme Court.

49:22.208 --> 49:23.833
Hye-in!

49:26.958 --> 49:28.791
Daddy's going home!

49:29.541 --> 49:30.541
You did good.

49:30.625 --> 49:32.000
It must've been tough for you.

49:32.083 --> 49:33.583
PARK HYEON-SUK - SPOKESPERSON
FOR YOON SEONG-HYEOP

49:33.666 --> 49:36.083
I'm Park Hyeon-suk
of the Creative People's Party.

49:36.166 --> 49:37.291
I see.

49:38.500 --> 49:39.500
One moment.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.083
- You go on ahead.
- You're so adorable.

49:45.041 --> 49:46.041
Yes?

49:46.666 --> 49:48.750
You've read the letter I sent,
haven't you?

49:48.833 --> 49:50.875
I understand that you were

49:50.958 --> 49:52.750
at the Laura Hill Hotel incident
last year.

49:53.333 --> 49:54.541
Let's talk about that day.

49:54.625 --> 49:55.958
My apologies.

49:57.291 --> 49:58.958
I heard there's a video
recorded from that day.

49:59.041 --> 50:00.625
Can we talk about it?

50:04.416 --> 50:06.458
Cho Sang-taek's son was also there, right?

50:06.541 --> 50:08.625
- What exactly do you want to know?
- Don't be like this.

50:09.250 --> 50:12.791
He ended up like this because they
believed some junkie's baseless claims.

50:12.875 --> 50:15.291
- Isn't that what you should look into?
- Stop it.

50:15.375 --> 50:16.416
Let's go.

50:19.875 --> 50:21.083
Come on.

50:21.166 --> 50:24.125
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!

50:24.208 --> 50:27.416
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!

50:27.500 --> 50:30.625
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!

50:30.708 --> 50:34.000
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!

50:34.083 --> 50:37.333
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!

50:37.416 --> 50:40.375
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!

50:40.458 --> 50:43.625
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!
- Candidate no. 1, Cho Sang-taek!

50:43.708 --> 50:44.708
- Candidate no. 1...
- Candidate no. 1...

50:48.750 --> 50:49.750
Sir.

50:50.458 --> 50:51.875
Come in.

50:51.958 --> 50:55.083
Yeah, I know Park Hyeon-suk.
She's the spokesperson.

50:55.625 --> 50:57.958
No need to respond.
Just stay out of sight...

50:59.875 --> 51:04.458
No. I'll take care of it,
so just leave for a month and lay low!

51:04.541 --> 51:05.958
Don't you get it?

51:08.000 --> 51:09.083
Yeah.

51:09.166 --> 51:12.291
All right. Let's meet at Eclipse
before you leave.

51:13.916 --> 51:16.166
This fucker just won't listen
and just yaps away.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.916
This useless piece of shit.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.375
I heard you asked for me.
My apologies for being late.

51:21.458 --> 51:23.666
You're not late at all.
You're allowed to be.

51:23.750 --> 51:25.541
You're a famous prosecutor.

51:29.041 --> 51:30.875
Late or not, whatever.

51:32.583 --> 51:35.083
But this woman. Park Hyeon-suk!

51:35.583 --> 51:38.166
The election is less than a month away,

51:38.250 --> 51:42.375
and she's poking around
my friends' work and homes.

51:42.916 --> 51:45.500
Yapping about the Laura Hill case
from a year ago.

51:45.583 --> 51:47.291
WARRANT DENIED FOR PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE'S DRUG-USING SON

51:47.375 --> 51:48.833
Can't you do something about her?

51:50.875 --> 51:54.541
Park Hyeon-suk is a former journalist,
so she can be tenacious.

51:54.625 --> 51:56.833
She fixates on a few facts
and spins them into a narrative.

51:56.916 --> 51:58.041
Hey!

52:00.041 --> 52:02.000
Stop beating around the bush.

52:02.083 --> 52:05.541
Just tell me what you're going to do
about it, old man!

52:07.750 --> 52:10.583
Don't yell at me. I only just got here.

52:11.791 --> 52:13.125
Give me time to think.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.291
One minute.

52:26.291 --> 52:27.791
Here's what I suggest.

52:28.666 --> 52:31.500
<i>Chairman Kang Myeong-cheol,
who's locked up for accounting fraud,</i>

52:31.583 --> 52:34.250
<i>is a high school alumnus
of Candidate Yoon.</i>

52:35.583 --> 52:39.125
The total election fund delivered
to Yoon's side is ten billion won.

52:39.625 --> 52:42.750
Initially, it was three billion in cash,
including dollars.

52:42.833 --> 52:45.208
A week later, five billion in yen,

52:45.291 --> 52:49.791
and finally, three billion in cash
and gift cards.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.416
<i>Mr. Kang Myeong-cheol!</i>

52:52.125 --> 52:54.375
- The last figure is two billion!
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

52:54.458 --> 52:56.041
Three, five, then two!

52:56.125 --> 52:57.833
He's mixing up two and three.

52:57.916 --> 52:59.708
Chairman, please sit over here.

52:59.791 --> 53:03.208
I'm trying to help you
return to managing your company,

53:03.291 --> 53:06.083
so get your story straight.

53:06.166 --> 53:07.916
This is your lifeline.

53:08.916 --> 53:11.875
He'll say the mule was Park Hyeon-suk.

53:12.583 --> 53:13.875
Would that do?

53:15.666 --> 53:17.583
He really is a killer!

53:18.333 --> 53:19.500
What a genius!

53:23.000 --> 53:25.333
Shit, that's why I love you, Kwan-hui.

53:27.125 --> 53:30.208
Okay, I'll talk to Dad about it.

53:30.291 --> 53:33.250
Take good care of your friends,
keep them on leash.

53:33.333 --> 53:36.375
- Don't ruin things at the last minute.
- Oh, come on.

53:36.458 --> 53:38.958
Everyone's leaving by Saturday,
so just keep that in mind.

53:39.041 --> 53:40.166
Also,

53:40.708 --> 53:43.791
don't get involved with junkies
like Yeom Tae-su anymore.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.375
Trusting dealers will only backfire.

53:50.208 --> 53:51.583
Don't worry about it.

53:52.666 --> 53:54.916
I'm Superman, so it's fine.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.583
Join me and we'll make it happen!

53:58.666 --> 54:01.750
Come on, everyone!

54:04.458 --> 54:07.208
Don't they all look
like members of a cult?

54:08.375 --> 54:10.583
Like they're all high on something.

54:11.791 --> 54:14.875
- Cho Sang-taek!
- Cho Sang-taek!

54:38.583 --> 54:42.541
CHECK THE BLACK TAPE
UNDER THE OUTDOOR UNIT

54:44.333 --> 54:46.416
DO YOU HELP WITH THE INJECTION?

54:46.500 --> 54:51.666
NOT IN PERSON
SEND DEPOSIT, AND YOU GET A DROP

54:51.750 --> 54:54.958
MAYBE I'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE
SOME EVEN OFFER TO HANG OUT

54:55.041 --> 54:57.875
MANY OF THEM RUN
TO THE COPS TO SNITCH

54:59.375 --> 55:03.875
THIS IS MY ARM, I'LL PAY EXTRA

55:17.916 --> 55:19.041
Come in!

55:20.541 --> 55:21.625
Erica?

55:25.375 --> 55:26.500
Not bad.

55:30.458 --> 55:31.541
Relax.

55:32.041 --> 55:33.666
Be gentle.

55:43.125 --> 55:44.125
You got clean veins.

55:45.791 --> 55:47.416
My veins are good, so just poke anywhere.

55:50.708 --> 55:52.208
- Hey.
- Yeah?

55:52.708 --> 55:54.333
- What's your dosage?
- Two.

55:55.583 --> 55:57.041
Two?

55:57.125 --> 55:58.250
That's a lot.

55:58.333 --> 56:00.333
It ain't a big dea--

56:09.791 --> 56:10.833
Damn it!

56:17.750 --> 56:20.375
- First time in this room, Mr. Song?
- Yes, Prosecutor.

56:21.500 --> 56:24.916
Sensitive cases are pushed back

56:25.000 --> 56:27.583
- during the election season.
- Right.

56:27.666 --> 56:31.041
But this one is tied to a hot case.

56:31.125 --> 56:33.916
Look at me, forgetting to
even offer you a drink.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.666
I'm all over the place these days.

56:35.750 --> 56:38.458
Hot cases should be cooled off outside.

56:38.541 --> 56:39.708
What?

56:39.791 --> 56:42.791
Is this about Haesin's
Chairman Kang Myeong-cheol?

56:42.875 --> 56:46.500
I heard he's practically
commuting here from the detention center.

56:48.791 --> 56:50.375
You're sharp, you really are!

56:55.250 --> 56:57.958
The thing about Chairman Kang is,

56:58.041 --> 56:59.833
he embezzled ten billion.

57:00.333 --> 57:05.333
It was funneled
to Candidate Yoon's campaign.

57:05.416 --> 57:07.583
And Park Hyeon-suk made the delivery.

57:07.666 --> 57:12.500
We have the ledger detailing
the transactions and even his confession.

57:13.208 --> 57:16.458
But pulling the players out of the game

57:16.541 --> 57:20.416
this close to the election
will look very suspicious, am I right?

57:22.250 --> 57:26.166
Give me the source,
and I'll start the buzz.

57:26.250 --> 57:28.833
This case will spiral out of control.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.833
Can you keep the rhythm?

57:34.791 --> 57:37.250
I'm great with tambourines.

57:37.333 --> 57:40.291
This isn't your usual
tambourine work, my friend.

57:44.041 --> 57:46.916
Mr. Song, how many years have you been
reporting from here?

57:48.083 --> 57:50.833
Four years now, Prosecutor.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.625
Stop calling me "Prosecutor."
Four years in, you're practically family.

57:56.708 --> 57:59.125
Just call me "bro."

58:00.833 --> 58:04.041
<i>The 21st presidential election is
now less than two weeks away.</i>

58:04.125 --> 58:05.458
<i>SBC's latest poll shows...</i>

58:05.541 --> 58:07.291
- Eat up.
- Come in, sir.

58:07.375 --> 58:10.000
<i>...the gap between candidates
Cho and Yoon has narrowed,</i>

58:10.083 --> 58:11.791
<i>making the election a tight match.</i>

58:12.500 --> 58:15.583
<i>Compared to the poll
conducted ten days ago...</i>

58:15.666 --> 58:18.750
Why aren't you coming in?
Want a cigarette?

58:19.541 --> 58:21.625
Damn it, I quit behind bars.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.916
Did you look into Yeom Tae-su?

58:25.000 --> 58:28.791
Either he's gone into hiding
or fled overseas,

58:28.875 --> 58:30.875
he's been radio-silent for over a year.

58:30.958 --> 58:33.416
I need to find that bastard
and put him on trial.

58:34.250 --> 58:37.541
I sold my house to pay the lawyer
a 100 million retainer.

58:37.625 --> 58:39.375
If I lose at the third trial,

58:40.666 --> 58:42.875
I'll have to raise Hye-in
in a rented studio.

58:42.958 --> 58:47.333
Give me Jong-su and one capable guy.

58:49.250 --> 58:51.041
Who's good among the rookies?

58:51.125 --> 58:55.000
You'll likely win the trial anyway.

58:55.083 --> 59:01.000
If you keep poking around,
the prosecutors will lose it.

59:01.500 --> 59:05.333
Why do the police always have to
tiptoe around the prosecutors?

59:06.333 --> 59:09.916
How could we not
after what they did to you?

59:11.833 --> 59:17.250
Back us up on paperwork
until the trial's over.

59:17.333 --> 59:19.333
I'm a captain now,

59:19.416 --> 59:23.666
and if you come out to the field,
the kids won't like it.

59:24.708 --> 59:27.333
Jeez, I'm sorry.

59:29.916 --> 59:33.000
Sons of bitches. You guys full?

59:38.791 --> 59:39.875
Hey!

59:55.000 --> 59:56.041
Lee Kang-su!

59:56.125 --> 59:57.375
Long time no see!

59:57.458 --> 01:00:00.375
You've got some balls showing up here!

01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:04.416
Good to see you.
We got a lot to catch up on!

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:08.541
Do you want to cuff yourself
or should I do it?

01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:11.791
If you start with handcuffs,

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.083
we can't have a civil chat.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:17.833
I've come to help you.

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:21.166
Who are you trying to fool?

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:38.041
Listen to me!

01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:39.375
Just listen!

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.416
Where is Yeom Tae-su?

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.458
You set me up, didn't you?
You ordered Yeom Tae-su to do it!

01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:48.958
I said, listen to me!

01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:52.291
You and me. We both got set up.

01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:56.041
I didn't order Yeom Tae-su
to set you up, you fucker!

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:57.458
Then who did?

01:00:57.958 --> 01:00:59.291
Detective Oh.

01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:15.416
It's not like I expected it,

01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:18.541
but not a single apology?

01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:20.083
I'm disappointed.

01:01:22.833 --> 01:01:24.416
You've become a full-on junkie.

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.458
Yes, all thanks to you.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:32.250
When I was released,
only junkies reached out to me.

01:01:33.625 --> 01:01:34.916
Damn, that stings!

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:47.916
Yeom Tae-su lit my legs on fire
and injected drugs in me.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.250
Fuck. Both of my legs were melting,

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:54.791
<i>but I was so high after a hit,
I didn't feel the pain.</i>

01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.875
<i>He kept me drugged up for a month.</i>

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:03.833
Detective, you want to catch
that bastard, right?

01:02:03.916 --> 01:02:05.083
I'm...

01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:12.625
fucking dying to see him.

01:02:13.208 --> 01:02:14.458
At least the motive's solid.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.416
You asked me who it was.

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:23.583
Cho Hun.
The guy looking at his phone. That's him.

01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:26.250
<i>Presidential candidate
Cho Sang-taek's son.</i>

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.375
<i>He made me an addict.</i>

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:40.375
I bet even Prosecutor Gu
freaked out over this.

01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:41.708
Of all people,

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:45.125
he happens to be the son
of a leading presidential candidate.

01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:48.250
A snitch who fetched a sensitive case,

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.833
an actress who was at the scene,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.583
and a Narcotics Unit officer
who was investigating the case.

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:56.208
He cleared out
the three troublemakers in one go.

01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:57.291
So,

01:02:57.791 --> 01:02:59.500
you'll take down a chief prosecutor

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:03.000
and the son
of a leading presidential candidate?

01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:05.958
How?

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:08.458
I had a nuclear bomb.

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:10.000
Okay, let's go!

01:03:10.083 --> 01:03:14.458
<i>The video I shot at Laura Hill Hotel
when Cho Hun got caught red-handed.</i>

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.291
Where is it now?

01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:19.458
It's...

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.291
in Yeom Tae-su's possession.

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.500
And where is he now?

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:32.083
<i>He's exporting top-quality
North Korean meth to Japan.</i>

01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:35.666
<i>Kim Hak-nam in Incheon
had the exclusive right to it,</i>

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.583
<i>but Yeom Tae-su snatched it away.</i>

01:03:37.666 --> 01:03:38.916
TAKESHI YAMAMOTO
JAPANESE DRUG DEALER

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.166
<i>A reward for getting rid of us.</i>

01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:44.166
<i>There's a way to lure him out of hiding.</i>

01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:47.375
If we intercept his drugs
during transport,

01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:48.708
he'll come crawling.

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:52.083
There's a party Cho Hun
is hosting this Friday.

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:54.791
The guest list includes
the usual suspects, including me.

01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:57.750
It's a one-time opportunity.
By Saturday, they'll all fly out.

01:03:57.833 --> 01:04:00.750
I'll film Cho Hun getting high there.

01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:03.833
That'll be the irrefutable evidence
to knock him down.

01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:06.791
It's three on three.
Let's face one each, head-on.

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:09.666
Yeom Tae-su.

01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:12.083
Prosecutor Gu.

01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:13.666
Cho Hun for her.

01:04:18.791 --> 01:04:20.000
All right.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.750
I'm out after arresting Yeom Tae-su,

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.125
you two handle the rest, got it?

01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:30.250
Quitting drugs is tough.
You think it was easy for me?

01:04:32.791 --> 01:04:34.958
Why are you asking me?
I don't know!

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.791
What the fuck am I doing with junkies?

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:41.541
Okay!

01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:44.125
A handshake? Fuck off.

01:04:45.708 --> 01:04:47.458
All right, you got that fighting spirit.

01:04:55.666 --> 01:04:57.666
Three kilograms of eel for Table Seven!

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.458
Three kilos!

01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:01.291
Three kilos?

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:04.250
Three kilos of meth, that's 700 million
per kilo. Totaling 2.1 billion.

01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:06.416
- Am I right?
- Hey.

01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:09.000
- That knife...
- Who are you?

01:05:10.125 --> 01:05:12.125
- Hak-nam!
- Holy shit!

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.375
We've come to rejuvenate.

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:14.750
You piece of shit...

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:22.750
My leg!

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.333
Why would a snitching punk do me a favor?

01:05:35.416 --> 01:05:39.458
Detective, we're
in the distribution business!

01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:43.083
If we reveal the whole chain,
they can't live on.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.708
They're all my boys too.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:49.458
Eat up and be on your way.

01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:55.208
- Hak-nam!
- Yes?

01:05:56.833 --> 01:05:59.000
Yeom Tae-su really got you spooked, huh?

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.458
Drug trafficking, smuggling,
head of a drug ring...

01:06:05.916 --> 01:06:08.333
Should I cuff you or Yeom Tae-su?

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:10.041
Yeom Tae-su?

01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:11.916
Yeah, Yeom Tae-su!

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.166
Sit back down.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:17.750
Yeom Tae-su, the guy
who forced you into exile.

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:19.500
I'm talking about that bastard.

01:06:20.708 --> 01:06:22.541
How can I help you?

01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:26.916
<i>Tell me about
how the North Korean blue meth</i>

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.166
<i>that gets imported through China
reaches Yeom Tae-su.</i>

01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:30.916
Where is it?

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.416
INCHEON PORT

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:38.208
<i>When my girls bring in goods
from China to Incheon,</i>

01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:42.208
<i>they're transported to the factory
and packaged nicely.</i>

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:48.083
<i>Then, Yamamoto's live fish truck
comes from Japan to our factory.</i>

01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:51.291
<i>The truck is driven
by one of Yamamoto's guys</i>

01:06:51.916 --> 01:06:54.125
<i>and one of Yeom's men.</i>

01:06:55.416 --> 01:06:58.125
<i>They load the truck with eels and meth,</i>

01:06:58.208 --> 01:07:01.083
and drive straight to Busan
to meet with Yeom Tae-su.

01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:06.458
It's a direct route,
but they make just one stop.

01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:09.833
<i>At Yeongsin Fish Restaurant
near Sujeong-dong, Incheon.</i>

01:07:09.916 --> 01:07:14.666
<i>The Japanese driver can't get enough
of their fish cake stew.</i>

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.125
<i>Oishii!</i>

01:07:16.208 --> 01:07:17.208
When?

01:07:18.166 --> 01:07:21.541
They're coming
on an early Friday morning ferry.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The room where Haesin Construction's
Chairman Kang Myeong-cheol

01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:32.416
handed over five billion in cash to
Park Hyeon-suk of Creative People's Party

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.625
is this one, Bride Mask Room.

01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:34.708
BRIDE MASK ROOM

01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:36.333
PARK HYEON-SUK RECEIVED
5 BILLION FOR YOON'S CAMPAIGN

01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:41.333
<i>This is where Chairman Kang
handed over the money to Park Hyeon-suk,</i>

01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:42.958
<i>and the prosecutors revealed that</i>

01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:45.291
<i>the cash funded
Yoon Seong-hyeop's campaign.</i>

01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:48.916
All signals have been blocked
on this camera.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.041
With this cover, it'll be undetectable.

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:58.833
How is it?

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.000
Not bad.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:07.375
If it feels too dangerous, bail out,
and call me if anything happens.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:10.083
I think you said
something similar a year ago...

01:08:10.166 --> 01:08:11.166
Hey!

01:08:13.166 --> 01:08:14.166
Back then, I--

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:15.250
Don't apologize.

01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:18.041
I'm not ready yet.

01:08:19.208 --> 01:08:21.541
And let me make one thing clear.

01:08:22.791 --> 01:08:24.791
I'm doing this because I want to.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.000
Are you ready? All set?

01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:45.500
Once you get the footage, text me.

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:49.291
Just focus on your own tasks, okay?

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.916
- Yeah.
- Bye!

01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:52.541
- Hey!
- What?

01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:53.625
You scared?

01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:55.916
Scared? Hell no.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Let's go!

01:09:07.583 --> 01:09:09.541
You think this plan will work?

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:12.750
Depends on
how well you follow Su-jin's lead.

01:09:12.833 --> 01:09:15.583
A washed-up snitch
is preaching to me now?

01:09:15.666 --> 01:09:18.875
Junkies have no manners
or respect for hierarchy.

01:09:18.958 --> 01:09:20.500
Jeez, I told you I quit!

01:09:20.583 --> 01:09:22.458
Stop calling me a junkie, all right?

01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:24.750
If you could quit just like that,
can you call that a drug?

01:09:24.833 --> 01:09:26.458
You junkie.

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:28.291
There's a way to quit...

01:09:28.833 --> 01:09:30.250
Fuck it, forget it!

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:32.958
Just put on your seat belt!

01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:37.708
Damn it, where the hell is the seat belt?

01:09:38.958 --> 01:09:41.458
Great teamwork. We're so fucked.

01:09:42.375 --> 01:09:44.791
YEONGSIN FISH RESTAURANT
INCHEON FISH MARKET

01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:48.000
FRIDAY

01:09:50.333 --> 01:09:53.416
Wouldn't it be easier to just grab
those bastards and mess them up?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.208
What is it?

01:09:56.875 --> 01:09:59.875
We need to get the goods first, okay?

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:03.458
After that, catching Yeom Tae-su
will be a piece of cake.

01:10:03.541 --> 01:10:06.916
Once he realizes his stash is gone,
he'll go berserk and come running.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.041
All right, I hear you!

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.291
Just keep a lookout.

01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:11.708
You got ten minutes!

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.250
Keep it down!

01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:17.208
Goddamn junkie.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.000
Hey, Su-jin.

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:25.291
You know how there are
lots of rehab centers abroad?

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:29.166
But we don't have that here.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.958
We should start one.

01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:35.000
Find a scenic spot overseas,
lock them up tight,

01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:38.750
charge ten million per head
and, boom, a gold mine!

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:40.916
Junkies can't afford quitting drugs.

01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:44.000
Hey, I'd take you in for free!

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:49.291
You need someone by your side to quit,
you know that?

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:52.375
Bring you proper food, cheer you on...

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:53.875
There's so much to do.

01:11:17.083 --> 01:11:18.416
Get down!

01:11:25.041 --> 01:11:26.458
What? What is it?

01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:29.666
Boss, what brings you here?

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:32.875
That fucking bastard.

01:11:32.958 --> 01:11:34.458
I need some hangover soup.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:36.916
- Let's head inside, sir.
- Sure.

01:11:37.916 --> 01:11:39.708
You've got to tell me what's going on!

01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:41.625
<i>What is it?</i>

01:11:49.125 --> 01:11:51.333
Where the hell did he go?

01:11:51.416 --> 01:11:52.875
He should've told me before making a move!

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.166
One moment, please.

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.875
- I'll need to check your bag.
- Just let her in!

01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:13.958
Hop on quickly!

01:12:20.666 --> 01:12:21.916
You're all set.

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:38.291
Boss, the goods are great.
We even saved the leftovers.

01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:42.541
Japanese guys will be
at Gamcheon Port, Dock Three.

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:43.625
<i>Oishii.</i>

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:46.625
Say "delicious" in Korean.
Don't speak Japanese, asshole.

01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:48.125
Yeom Tae-su!

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:53.458
It's damn good to see you, asshole.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.250
We got some catching up to do, right?

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:02.416
Put them on, asshole.

01:13:05.166 --> 01:13:07.291
Why do you make things so complicated?

01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:14.000
<i>Chotto matte!</i>

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.291
You son of a bitch!

01:13:20.791 --> 01:13:22.041
- Yeom Tae-su!
- Gun!

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:23.916
Grab his gun!

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.083
Gun!

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:26.625
Get his gun!

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:28.833
Grab his gun!

01:13:55.958 --> 01:13:57.500
Oh, the goods!

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:05.250
Why are the eels on the ground?

01:14:06.666 --> 01:14:08.083
What's that sound?

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:16.166
Lee Kang-su, you asshole!

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:56.625
Die, you son of a bitch!

01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:21.500
Yeom Tae-su.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:23.291
You fucking bastard!

01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:30.625
Shit... Detective.

01:15:31.708 --> 01:15:33.416
Are you allowed to do this?

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.958
Shit!

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:47.000
Where's the footage? Spit it out!

01:15:47.083 --> 01:15:50.833
The watch...

01:15:50.916 --> 01:15:52.416
It's inside the watch!

01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:57.000
<i>Come out.</i>

01:15:57.583 --> 01:15:58.583
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:15:59.333 --> 01:16:00.791
<i>How about we get you on TV?</i>

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:02.541
<i>Take care of him.</i>

01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:04.041
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:05.208
Stop!

01:16:06.458 --> 01:16:08.291
That's all for the teaser.

01:16:08.375 --> 01:16:10.875
Su-jin's footage will be the main event.

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:05.125
We got something.

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:07.458
- She did it.
- Okay!

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:08.666
Let's begin.

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:09.750
Okay!

01:17:13.875 --> 01:17:16.916
Is this the prosecution?
I'd like to report a drug deal.

01:17:34.458 --> 01:17:36.583
Let me ask you one thing.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:40.250
It was Prosecutor Gu that ordered you
to make me a junkie, right?

01:17:42.083 --> 01:17:43.125
<i>Should I kill him?</i>

01:17:43.958 --> 01:17:46.708
You've got to watch what you say.

01:17:51.541 --> 01:17:54.875
You're a dealer,
then you must have some leftovers!

01:17:56.708 --> 01:17:57.750
No?

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:03.375
A snitch that dared
to collude with a prosecutor.

01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:15.083
Stay right here, okay?

01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:21.666
<i>Can you comment on the confession
by Haesin's Chairman Kang?</i>

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:23.666
<i>Is it true that ten billion
was embezzled for Candidate Yoon?</i>

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:28.625
<i>I have never received money
from Chairman Kang Myeong-cheol,</i>

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:30.208
<i>so how could I have delivered it
to Candidate Yoon?</i>

01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:31.291
Yes?

01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:32.958
Sir.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:35.000
We've received a drug-related tip-off.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.875
The location is a yacht
named Eclipse at Seoul Marina.

01:18:39.666 --> 01:18:41.541
- Eclipse?
- Yes.

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:52.875
That's part of our operation,
so don't send the Coast Guard.

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:54.416
It could mess everything up.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:57.791
- Sit!
- Sir, what's all that?

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.958
I arrested him red-handed
for drug dealing, 5 kg in total!

01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:04.833
I'll take the statement myself later, understood?

01:19:04.916 --> 01:19:06.250
Where are you going?

01:19:06.333 --> 01:19:09.000
He's stirring up trouble again.

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.333
Huh? I thought your role ended
after Yeom Tae-su's arrest.

01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:22.125
I need to make sure
Su-jin gets out safely.

01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:23.833
Start the car.

01:19:25.333 --> 01:19:29.041
Quiet! Be quiet! I said be quiet!

01:19:29.666 --> 01:19:32.750
You're all so fucking high.
What did you say?

01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:35.416
Someone may be trapping you,
so get out of there now.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.833
Right now!

01:19:36.916 --> 01:19:38.833
Didn't you say
you blocked the Coast Guard?

01:19:38.916 --> 01:19:42.958
<i>They know the yacht's name
and exact location, so hurry up!</i>

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:57.416
NARCO UNIT CATFISH

01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:05.500
- Yes?
- Sir,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Detective Oh brought in Yeom Tae-su.

01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:12.958
<i>Detective Oh brought in Yeom Tae-su?</i>

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:18.000
Yes, it seems like
he was working with Lee Kang-su.

01:20:18.958 --> 01:20:20.416
Lee Kang-su?

01:20:21.833 --> 01:20:24.375
You sure it was Lee Kang-su?
Are you not mistaken?

01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:27.791
I'm not.
I looked into it just to make sure,

01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:30.833
and it seems Eom Su-jin
is also on Lee Kang-su's side.

01:20:30.916 --> 01:20:34.125
<i>You know, the actress
who was caught at Laura Hill.</i>

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:35.916
<i>The three of them are together.</i>

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:40.250
Lee Kang-su, Eom Su-jin
and Oh Sang-jae.

01:20:41.916 --> 01:20:44.166
<i>So, Eom Su-jin is on the yacht.</i>

01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:48.041
Don't make calls like a fool
when you fly out.

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:50.083
- Use Telegram. all right?
- Yes, all right.

01:20:50.166 --> 01:20:51.541
Hey, Su-jin.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:57.083
Don't contact anyone
until the election is over.

01:20:57.166 --> 01:20:59.083
Got it.

01:21:00.708 --> 01:21:01.958
Are you kidding me?

01:21:02.666 --> 01:21:05.125
Don't give me a half-assed answer.

01:21:08.833 --> 01:21:10.333
Answer me.

01:21:13.708 --> 01:21:15.125
CHIEF PROSECUTOR GU KWAN-HUI

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:25.250
Goddamn it...

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:34.291
Don't go around acting like a meth head,

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.666
causing unnecessary trouble.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:39.208
That won't happen.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.208
Hey, move your car! Move!

01:21:52.166 --> 01:21:53.208
Let's go, quick.

01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:55.625
<i>Are you with Eom Su-jin?</i>

01:22:03.291 --> 01:22:05.375
- I did it!
- Good job, fuck!

01:22:05.458 --> 01:22:08.000
Kang-su, we're on our way back!

01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:09.708
We're leaving Yeouido now.

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.166
- Keep the video safe.
<i>- Okay!</i>

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:12.791
Put Su-jin on.

01:22:13.458 --> 01:22:14.541
What's going on?

01:22:15.291 --> 01:22:17.166
Put your face away!

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:19.125
<i>- Just talk on the phone!</i>
- Why?

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.083
- Come on, let's talk face-to-face.
- <i>Well done.</i>

01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:24.458
<i>You said you'd knock Cho Hun down.</i>

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:26.625
<i>Keep your promise.</i>

01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:28.833
I'll make him pay for what he did to you.

01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:29.916
Okay.

01:22:30.458 --> 01:22:32.041
Put Jade Emperor on.

01:22:32.708 --> 01:22:33.916
What now?

01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:36.041
<i>Look at me.</i>

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:39.208
<i>The job's done. No need for face-to-face.</i>

01:22:39.291 --> 01:22:40.958
I'm driving. Hold the phone!

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:44.750
<i>Happy now? Here.</i>

01:22:46.041 --> 01:22:47.583
Got nothing to say to me?

01:22:48.208 --> 01:22:51.000
Let's hear a formal apology
in front of everyone.

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:54.708
<i>Just do it already!</i>

01:22:54.791 --> 01:22:57.375
<i>Crying and begging
wouldn't be so bad, either.</i>

01:22:57.458 --> 01:23:00.708
Just say it, what's the big deal? Jeez.

01:23:00.791 --> 01:23:02.125
For fuck's sake...

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:07.250
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:13.000
<i>I did a terrible thing to you.</i>

01:23:13.833 --> 01:23:16.333
<i>Forget it. That's what--</i>

01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:26.458
Hello?

01:23:27.458 --> 01:23:28.541
Why did it cut off?

01:23:29.583 --> 01:23:30.750
Su-jin!

01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:32.916
Hello?

01:23:35.458 --> 01:23:37.291
- Hello?
- Give it...

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:39.291
Call again.

01:23:48.541 --> 01:23:49.791
Chang-rak...

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:53.625
Chang-rak...

01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:56.833
Someone call 911!

01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:58.958
Chang-rak...

01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:02.250
Help me...

01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:06.208
Are you okay?

01:24:07.666 --> 01:24:09.250
Please help...

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:16.083
Help me...

01:24:16.166 --> 01:24:17.541
Can you hear me?

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.791
Sir. Wait, you can't go in there!

01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:00.583
Stop! It's dangerous!

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:03.166
- No, please don't!
- What's wrong with you?

01:25:05.583 --> 01:25:07.333
- Let go!
- It's dangerous!

01:25:07.916 --> 01:25:10.625
- Piss off!
- Please calm down!

01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:44.791
Let's call it quits.

01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:48.833
No good comes from a cop
working with a snitch for too long.

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:55.083
You got Yeom Tae-su like you wanted.

01:25:57.666 --> 01:25:58.750
So go now.

01:26:00.666 --> 01:26:01.666
And you?

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
What will you do?

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.750
I'll post the footage online,

01:26:10.125 --> 01:26:11.750
and leave this shithole country.

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:21.458
So, it's over?

01:26:25.208 --> 01:26:26.208
This is it?

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:31.291
Not before I apologize to Su-jin.

01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:32.625
To your friend as well!

01:26:42.666 --> 01:26:46.875
Let's end Cho Hun just as Su-jin wanted.

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:48.416
And tie Prosecutor Gu into it, too.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.416
How can we do that without anything solid?

01:26:56.333 --> 01:27:00.833
Let's do some real snitching.

01:27:09.125 --> 01:27:10.375
Hey, Kwan-hui.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:13.166
Did you eat?

01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:18.875
I've lost my appetite.

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:37.625
Lee Kang-su and Oh Sang-jae
are listed on the call log.

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:42.583
They're the headaches, right?

01:27:45.958 --> 01:27:46.958
Looks like it.

01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:53.666
You bragged
that everything was under control!

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:55.666
Shit...

01:27:56.750 --> 01:28:01.125
Is it that hard to clean shit up
without any traces?

01:28:04.416 --> 01:28:06.291
It's not hard...

01:28:08.375 --> 01:28:10.208
It's not hard at all, but you keep...

01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:17.916
Can you please just stay quiet?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.416
Is that so fucking hard?

01:28:21.416 --> 01:28:24.916
Kwan-hui, have you gone mad?

01:28:26.708 --> 01:28:27.958
Who's mad, huh?

01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:31.916
There's news and gossip
stirring things up every single day,

01:28:32.458 --> 01:28:34.666
and you had to cause more trouble?

01:28:36.166 --> 01:28:37.958
Mr. Cho, look at me.

01:28:38.916 --> 01:28:40.375
A Korean prosecutor

01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:44.375
can make or break a president.

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:51.083
You fucker.

01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:56.583
Anyway, I'll handle this.

01:28:57.166 --> 01:28:58.875
Clean and neat, without any traces.

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:11.833
What the hell's wrong with him?

01:29:22.083 --> 01:29:23.541
<i>So you're the boss around here, huh?</i>

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:25.125
<i>A handsome fellow.</i>

01:29:25.208 --> 01:29:26.708
<i>How about we get you on TV?</i>

01:29:26.791 --> 01:29:29.125
NO CALLER ID

01:30:03.375 --> 01:30:04.875
It's been a while.

01:30:06.791 --> 01:30:08.125
Have you been well?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.083
You look great.

01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.083
Yeah?

01:30:14.708 --> 01:30:17.333
You too. Has it been a year?

01:30:19.083 --> 01:30:20.916
Seeing that video brought back memories.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.375
So you had it?

01:30:25.541 --> 01:30:27.791
Let me have it. It's nothing to you.

01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:30.583
- Fuck you.
- What did you say?

01:30:31.458 --> 01:30:32.750
You motherfucker.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.083
Why would I give it to you?

01:30:36.166 --> 01:30:37.833
If you'd asked nicely then,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.125
I would've given it to you.

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:42.166
Kang-su, buddy.

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:45.791
I think you're seriously mistaken.

01:30:45.875 --> 01:30:50.250
If this is about what happened a year ago,
let's talk it out.

01:30:50.916 --> 01:30:54.416
It wasn't me.
Would I have ordered something like that?

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:55.500
Ordered?

01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:57.625
Ordered what?

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.541
You talk as if you know what was ordered.

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:06.333
You told me not to do drugs.

01:31:08.375 --> 01:31:09.958
You said you were my fucking brother!

01:31:11.458 --> 01:31:13.416
And you stick a needle in your brother?

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.625
You think I studied my ass off

01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:19.208
just to spend my life

01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:23.125
chasing junkies like you?

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:25.208
You bastard.

01:31:26.291 --> 01:31:29.041
I don't know what kind of crap
you're pulling right now,

01:31:29.666 --> 01:31:31.000
but stop it.

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.500
Or else, you'll kill me too?

01:31:35.166 --> 01:31:36.916
I'm capable of it, don't you think?

01:31:38.333 --> 01:31:40.125
You saw how I handle things.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.541
Okay.

01:31:49.541 --> 01:31:53.041
Then look forward to
what I'm going to do next,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.958
and what I'll unleash very soon.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.541
The next time we meet, it'll be in hell.

01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:14.375
Fucking moron.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:30.166
Oh, boy. First time in Seoul in so long.

01:32:31.083 --> 01:32:35.833
You should have killed Yeom Tae-su.
Why hand him over to Jade Emperor?

01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:42.666
Yeom Tae-su's drug shipment
meant for Yamamoto...

01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:44.125
I intercepted it.

01:32:45.375 --> 01:32:46.583
How many?

01:32:46.666 --> 01:32:47.916
Twenty-five.

01:32:50.583 --> 01:32:53.583
Yamamoto's going to kill him for sure.

01:32:53.666 --> 01:32:55.458
That guy has a terrible temper.

01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:57.833
One big bundle of cash per kilo,
25 big bucks in total.

01:32:58.333 --> 01:32:59.625
It's a bargain.

01:33:01.583 --> 01:33:02.916
So what do you want me to do?

01:33:04.458 --> 01:33:07.083
Get me a boat to China for two passengers.

01:33:07.166 --> 01:33:09.166
The other one's for Jade Emperor?

01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:14.333
Hey, what are you two up to?

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.708
We're going to pull a job
on Prosecutor Gu and take off.

01:33:23.791 --> 01:33:25.958
Prosecutor Gu? Gu Kwan-hui?

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:29.041
Are you high?

01:33:30.083 --> 01:33:32.333
Keep those hits for yourself.

01:33:32.916 --> 01:33:34.666
Get the money and boat ready.

01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:36.583
And I'm totally sober.

01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:41.000
How's the kid?

01:33:44.416 --> 01:33:46.250
It's going to take some time.

01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:47.750
Don't worry.

01:33:49.375 --> 01:33:50.625
I'm sorry.

01:33:56.291 --> 01:33:57.458
Let's move.

01:33:59.958 --> 01:34:01.083
Should I prep the money?

01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:04.291
Hold on. Can't you hear my gears spinning?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.416
<i>This is where Ko Chang-rak,</i>

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.666
<i>the one who died yesterday,
lived with Kang-su.</i>

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:15.000
<i>We just need to find the video
that Lee Kang-su has.</i>

01:34:18.458 --> 01:34:21.208
He hasn't come here in a while.
How many times must I tell you?

01:34:22.958 --> 01:34:25.291
Fucking hell, this feels off.

01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:28.250
I should've locked him up that night.

01:34:28.333 --> 01:34:29.625
Sir!

01:34:29.708 --> 01:34:30.833
Yes?

01:34:33.541 --> 01:34:35.333
- Please take this call.
- Who is it?

01:34:35.416 --> 01:34:38.916
I'm right on Lee Kang-su's tail.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.333
I want to help you
and leave a good impression, sir.

01:34:42.416 --> 01:34:45.125
Sounds like you want something from me.

01:34:45.208 --> 01:34:46.583
<i>Yeom Tae-su, sir.</i>

01:34:46.666 --> 01:34:49.541
You know that he took my spot, right?

01:34:49.625 --> 01:34:51.541
Give me Lee Kang-su's location.

01:34:51.625 --> 01:34:53.916
<i>He's headed
to Assemblywoman Park Hyeon-suk</i>

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.041
<i>to hand over a video and a recording
containing your voice.</i>

01:34:58.916 --> 01:35:00.541
YOON SEONG-HYEOP

01:35:03.458 --> 01:35:04.666
I'm off.

01:35:07.083 --> 01:35:08.708
Give it up. There's no time.

01:35:10.708 --> 01:35:12.375
I'll go ahead and get everything ready.

01:35:15.083 --> 01:35:17.625
This is our only chance. Don't mess it up.

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.541
Everything will work out.
Don't be a chicken shit.

01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:24.916
Hey!

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.625
- Candidate no.2, Yoon Seong-hyeop!
- Candidate no.2, Yoon Seong-hyeop!

01:35:38.583 --> 01:35:41.166
Candidate no. 2, Yoon Seong-hyeop!

01:35:41.708 --> 01:35:44.791
- Candidate no. 2, Yoon Seong-hyeop!
- No. 2!

01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:49.416
- Candidate no.2, Yoon Seong-hyeop!
- Candidate no.2, Yoon Seong-hyeop!

01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:53.375
- Where are you going?
- You can't go any further.

01:35:53.458 --> 01:35:55.958
I'm Detective Oh Sang-jae
from the Narcotics Unit.

01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:57.958
I have something to deliver
to Ms. Park Hyeon-suk.

01:35:58.041 --> 01:35:59.291
We'll pass it along for you.

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.833
No, I must give it to her myself.

01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:03.916
You can't go any further.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.916
Ms. Park! Ma'am! Ma'am!

01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:08.916
It's me, Oh Sang-jae!

01:36:10.166 --> 01:36:11.166
Grab him!

01:36:11.916 --> 01:36:12.916
Ms. Park Hyeon-suk!

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.958
Mr. Oh Sang-jae, you are under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

01:36:16.041 --> 01:36:18.250
- Ma'am, it's me, Oh Sang-jae!
- Shut him up!

01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:23.083
Prosecutors' Office!

01:36:23.666 --> 01:36:25.166
Lee Kang-su wasn't there.

01:36:29.041 --> 01:36:31.916
You sure made a lot of copies,
Detective Oh.

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:36.291
Yes, sir, I made so many.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:40.250
I'm going to spread it
all over the country.

01:36:40.333 --> 01:36:41.875
Where's Lee Kang-su?

01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:46.833
He's already skipped town.
It's over between us.

01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:57.666
<i>Tonight's third presidential debate
hosted by the National Election Commission</i>

01:36:57.750 --> 01:37:00.041
<i>is expected to focus on</i>

01:37:00.125 --> 01:37:03.250
<i>Candidate Cho Sang-taek's son's
drug allegations.</i>

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:18.666
You'll release this?

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:20.000
You said so yourself,

01:37:20.083 --> 01:37:23.208
"Hot cases should be cooled off outside."

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.250
Even so, this is way too hot.

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:29.500
Why? Scared?

01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:34.166
Bro, are you switching sides?

01:37:35.625 --> 01:37:38.541
A prosecutor investigates
when there's a crime, no?

01:37:39.333 --> 01:37:42.416
Same goes for reporters.
You pursue the truth.

01:37:43.291 --> 01:37:44.375
You don't take sides.

01:37:48.291 --> 01:37:50.375
Sir, you need to step inside.

01:37:50.458 --> 01:37:51.583
Why?

01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:54.083
Something urgent has come up.
Please go inside for now.

01:37:54.791 --> 01:37:58.250
<i>The face of Cho Hun
has now been identified clearly.</i>

01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:01.541
<i>If his drug use is confirmed,
it's only a matter of time...</i>

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:04.958
What the fuck, Prosecutor Gu?
A prosecutorial summons?

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.083
Are you out of your mind?

01:38:07.833 --> 01:38:10.500
Try to see the big picture here.

01:38:10.583 --> 01:38:11.708
<i>Kwan-hui, bro.</i>

01:38:11.791 --> 01:38:14.333
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:38:14.416 --> 01:38:17.166
Mr. Cho, come in willingly.

01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:19.416
Otherwise, I'll come
with an arrest warrant.

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:20.500
What?

01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:26.125
That fucking bastard.

01:38:26.208 --> 01:38:27.208
Mr. Song.

01:38:28.041 --> 01:38:32.333
Cho Hun is coming in himself.
Let the press know.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.833
<i>The case has been assigned</i>

01:38:36.916 --> 01:38:40.250
<i>to Chief Prosecutor Gu Kwan-hui's
Anti-Corruption Division Three.</i>

01:38:40.333 --> 01:38:42.958
- Shit...
<i>- Mr. Cho Hun will appear</i>

01:38:43.041 --> 01:38:45.125
<i>at the Central District
Prosecutors' Office by 9 p.m. tonight.</i>

01:38:45.208 --> 01:38:47.666
Prosecutor Gu...

01:38:49.916 --> 01:38:51.458
That's Gu Kwan-hui for you.

01:38:57.791 --> 01:38:59.666
We're both investigating crimes,

01:39:00.166 --> 01:39:03.916
so we could've just talked it out
if there were misunderstandings.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.208
<i>Must we go this far?</i>

01:39:07.208 --> 01:39:10.083
Here's the form
for dropping your case.

01:39:10.791 --> 01:39:12.750
Once I fax this to the court,

01:39:12.833 --> 01:39:15.458
the acquittal from the second trial
will be upheld.

01:39:15.541 --> 01:39:20.333
Then you'll be able to continue
your police career, right?

01:39:20.416 --> 01:39:21.833
What are you doing?

01:39:22.583 --> 01:39:25.583
You already know what this is about.

01:39:25.666 --> 01:39:28.125
Kang-su has both the original
and the copies, right?

01:39:28.208 --> 01:39:29.708
Where's that bastard now?

01:39:31.166 --> 01:39:33.875
You can afford to keep it cool and smile?

01:39:34.583 --> 01:39:38.708
Is your daughter about six years old?
She's quite cute.

01:39:39.458 --> 01:39:41.666
Let's be civil about this
before things get cruel.

01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:44.333
You should protect your family, no?

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.625
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:40:03.041 --> 01:40:06.208
<i>Could you look up over there?</i>

01:40:06.833 --> 01:40:08.875
<i>I'm in front of the Central District
Prosecutors' Office.</i>

01:40:08.958 --> 01:40:12.166
<i>The final presidential debate
will take place tonight.</i>

01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:16.958
<i>Cho Hun, the son of Future Unity Party's
Cho Sang-taek, has arrived here</i>

01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:18.916
<i>for a voluntary drug test.</i>

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.708
You're called the "National Junkie,"
how do you feel?

01:40:23.666 --> 01:40:25.375
Do you admit to the charges?

01:40:26.375 --> 01:40:27.916
Mr. Cho Hun, one comment!

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.875
- Do you admit to the charges?
- A word, please!

01:40:43.541 --> 01:40:45.875
I could have come through
the underground parking lot.

01:40:45.958 --> 01:40:47.625
What is this, a circus?

01:40:48.916 --> 01:40:50.416
Where's Gu?

01:40:51.833 --> 01:40:53.625
Watch how you address him.

01:40:55.083 --> 01:40:56.625
It's quite unpleasant to hear.

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:06.875
Are you going to stay there?

01:41:13.666 --> 01:41:15.000
Have you given it some thought?

01:41:18.583 --> 01:41:21.875
- Let me have a cigarette.
- Yes, of course. Here.

01:41:30.666 --> 01:41:32.083
Send the fax first.

01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:33.416
Shall I?

01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:37.083
Here, send this fax over.

01:41:37.166 --> 01:41:38.416
Yes, sir.

01:41:41.625 --> 01:41:44.541
Here you go.

01:42:02.291 --> 01:42:03.750
Is this certain?

01:42:05.666 --> 01:42:06.958
Good work.

01:42:20.125 --> 01:42:21.125
Hello, sir.

01:42:21.708 --> 01:42:24.291
Find Lee Kang-su here.
No need to bring him in.

01:42:25.833 --> 01:42:27.125
Do you understand?

01:42:41.208 --> 01:42:42.791
Could you hurry up?

01:42:50.916 --> 01:42:52.291
The attorney can stay here.

01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:53.750
Why?

01:42:55.375 --> 01:42:58.291
He can still see you inside!

01:42:59.333 --> 01:43:01.458
It's not like your lawyer
will take a piss for you!

01:43:09.458 --> 01:43:11.583
Come on, you're not taking a shit.

01:43:12.291 --> 01:43:15.458
Use the urinal where I can see you.

01:43:26.958 --> 01:43:28.416
Shit!

01:43:42.166 --> 01:43:46.666
Gu Kwan-hui, you bastard!

01:44:05.875 --> 01:44:08.166
Holy shit!

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:11.708
What a plot twist.

01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:17.583
Mr. Oh Sang-jae.

01:44:17.666 --> 01:44:19.541
Live quietly once you're out.

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.166
Even if I live quietly...

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.291
I'm not sure the world will settle down.

01:44:28.375 --> 01:44:29.375
There you go again,

01:44:29.458 --> 01:44:31.833
yapping away
when you don't know any better.

01:45:07.625 --> 01:45:12.208
Mr. Park and I'll handle the report,
so stay here and get some rest.

01:45:13.666 --> 01:45:15.416
Thank you for your hard work.

01:45:41.041 --> 01:45:42.333
Thank you.

01:45:43.583 --> 01:45:46.333
By the way, whose urine was that?

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:51.791
It's from our section chief's
middle-school son.

01:45:53.083 --> 01:45:55.708
It will be very clean.

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:59.875
The test will come back negative,
no evidence of drug use.

01:45:59.958 --> 01:46:04.000
We'll release this as breaking news
right after the debate.

01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.833
We'll issue a warrant
for Park Hyeon-suk tomorrow.

01:46:06.916 --> 01:46:09.375
A week from now is the election day.

01:46:09.458 --> 01:46:13.958
By then, it'll be impossible
for Yoon's camp to react.

01:46:15.458 --> 01:46:18.333
You're really incredible, sir.

01:46:19.625 --> 01:46:22.458
Wait, about that Song guy...

01:46:22.541 --> 01:46:25.041
- The reporter, Song?
- Yes, him.

01:46:25.125 --> 01:46:29.375
I really want to tear him apart.
What should I do?

01:46:29.458 --> 01:46:30.958
No need for that.

01:46:31.625 --> 01:46:33.791
He won't be able to continue
his career anyway.

01:46:33.875 --> 01:46:36.791
Distributing footage against
someone's will violates

01:46:36.875 --> 01:46:40.583
Article 14 of the Sexual Violence
Punishment Act and is punishable

01:46:40.666 --> 01:46:42.583
by up to 7 years in prison
or a fine of up to 50 million won.

01:46:42.666 --> 01:46:45.125
The law will handle him for you.

01:46:45.208 --> 01:46:48.708
Just because he's allowed here,
he thinks he's a prosecutor.

01:46:52.458 --> 01:46:53.583
Good evening!

01:46:53.666 --> 01:46:54.958
- Prosecutor General!
- Hello.

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:56.541
- Hey, Kwan-hui.
- Evening, sir.

01:46:56.625 --> 01:46:58.583
I apologize for the trouble.

01:46:58.666 --> 01:47:00.791
It's not like anyone died.

01:47:00.875 --> 01:47:03.791
You were summoned over some drugs?

01:47:03.875 --> 01:47:05.583
Sorry for causing such a fuss, sir.

01:47:05.666 --> 01:47:08.875
I just spoke with your father
and reassured him.

01:47:08.958 --> 01:47:10.541
We're all family here.

01:47:10.625 --> 01:47:11.958
This was a major win.

01:47:12.041 --> 01:47:13.125
Not at all, sir.

01:47:13.625 --> 01:47:15.125
Thank you, sir.

01:47:15.208 --> 01:47:17.833
When your father was leading
the Special Investigation Unit 1,

01:47:17.916 --> 01:47:19.166
I learned a lot from him.

01:47:19.791 --> 01:47:22.541
I got scolded a lot
for being bad at investigations!

01:47:26.166 --> 01:47:27.750
We're almost there.

01:47:32.125 --> 01:47:33.875
There's the motherfucker.

01:47:36.458 --> 01:47:37.916
- The food's nice.
- Right, sir?

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.541
I'm sorry, sir, but my dad is on TV now,

01:47:41.625 --> 01:47:42.875
could we turn it on?

01:47:43.708 --> 01:47:45.250
May I turn on the TV?

01:47:45.333 --> 01:47:46.916
Go on, let's all watch.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.291
The debate is on now.

01:47:49.625 --> 01:47:50.958
<i>Next up is Candidate Yoon Seong-hyeop.</i>

01:47:51.041 --> 01:47:55.083
<i>Do not forget, you must direct questions
to at least two candidates.</i>

01:47:55.166 --> 01:47:58.041
<i>My question is to Candidate Cho Sang-taek.</i>

01:47:58.125 --> 01:47:59.250
- Kwan-hui.
- Yes, sir.

01:47:59.791 --> 01:48:01.416
When will you announce
the investigation results?

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.333
I plan to do it right after the debate.

01:48:03.416 --> 01:48:05.791
Timing is always crucial.

01:48:05.875 --> 01:48:07.250
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:11.083
Oh my, his future looks bright.

01:48:12.041 --> 01:48:15.875
If it's confirmed that my son used drugs,

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.125
I, Cho Sang-taek,

01:48:20.083 --> 01:48:22.375
will immediately withdraw
from the presidential race.

01:48:23.666 --> 01:48:25.750
<i>To build a proper country,</i>

01:48:26.291 --> 01:48:28.708
<i>the citizens have entrusted me--</i>

01:48:28.791 --> 01:48:32.083
Candidate Cho, I'm sorry to interrupt,

01:48:32.166 --> 01:48:37.333
<i>but a video is going viral on YouTube
and social media right now.</i>

01:48:37.416 --> 01:48:41.000
<i>We need to confirm this
before proceeding. Our apologies.</i>

01:48:44.541 --> 01:48:46.791
Kang-su!

01:48:48.625 --> 01:48:50.916
So fucking happy to see you.

01:48:53.291 --> 01:48:54.291
Hi.

01:48:56.625 --> 01:48:58.041
Came for this?

01:48:58.125 --> 01:49:02.125
Tae-su, thanks for coming this far!

01:49:02.208 --> 01:49:06.625
- Hope it wasn't hard finding here!
- I was worried you weren't coming.

<i>He's quickly trying to hide

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:41.333

- Lower it!

<i>Since the blinds are down,</i>

<i>It sounded like something was thrown.</i>

01:52:08.541 --> 01:52:10.916

Listen carefully. The attached office

Everyone, dig in!

01:52:28.666 --> 01:52:30.666
<i>That's where all the cover-ups take place.</i>

01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:35.375
You'll charge into
the prosecution yourself? How?

01:52:35.458 --> 01:52:38.250
Give Prosecutor Gu a call.

01:52:38.333 --> 01:52:39.958
Say you'll hand me over.

01:52:40.041 --> 01:52:41.750
Why should I help you?

01:52:41.833 --> 01:52:44.333
You're looking for Lee Kang-su, right?

01:52:44.416 --> 01:52:45.416
It's me, Oh Sang-jae!

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.208
<i>We have to reach the attached office
at all costs.</i>

01:52:50.250 --> 01:52:52.125
- Let me have a cigarette.
- Yes, of course.

01:52:52.208 --> 01:52:54.500
<i>Obviously, we don't need to
go in ourselves.</i>

01:53:00.541 --> 01:53:01.708
- Here.
- Yes, sir?

01:53:01.791 --> 01:53:03.666
- Send this fax over.
- Yes, sir.

01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:08.250
Hey.

Here you go.

01:53:27.333 --> 01:53:28.375
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:53:28.458 --> 01:53:30.000
And this one's mine.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.541
What, it's a matching set?

01:53:48.458 --> 01:53:50.541
<i>Let's do some real snitching.</i>

01:54:16.041 --> 01:54:18.250
That was fast.

01:54:19.041 --> 01:54:20.583
You came all this way?

01:54:20.666 --> 01:54:23.708
- You fucking asshole!
- Easy, man.

01:54:27.416 --> 01:54:28.708
Son of a bitch.

01:54:31.875 --> 01:54:35.458
You have no idea
what it took for me to get here...

01:54:35.541 --> 01:54:37.875
You hear me, you fucker?

01:54:51.166 --> 01:54:55.208
You should've held on tighter.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:03.166
I told you, if you fall from there,

01:55:04.458 --> 01:55:05.458
you'll be screwed.

01:55:16.583 --> 01:55:18.208
This view is a killer!

01:55:22.625 --> 01:55:23.625
Hey!

01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:42.291
I lost the election because I was lacking,

01:55:42.375 --> 01:55:44.291
and I think this is the price I--

01:55:44.791 --> 01:55:45.916
You piece of shit!

01:55:47.083 --> 01:55:50.166
CHO SANG-TAEK
"I LOST BECAUSE I'M LACKING"

01:55:52.208 --> 01:55:53.208
Hey, open up!

01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:55.583
I feel so bad for my dad...

01:55:55.666 --> 01:55:57.125
- Open up!
- Nope.

01:56:00.333 --> 01:56:02.291
- Come down, now.
- Get down here.

01:56:02.375 --> 01:56:05.541
Do you honestly think you can catch me?

01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:08.958
You'll never get me!

01:56:10.375 --> 01:56:12.291
Hey, you'll get hurt!

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.333
You bastard...

01:56:14.833 --> 01:56:15.916
Come with us quietly.

01:56:17.416 --> 01:56:19.916
Because I'm Superman.

01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:23.708
- Hey!
- Superman!

01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:51.041
Prosecutor Gu, please come out.

01:56:51.708 --> 01:56:52.708
Sir?

01:56:57.291 --> 01:56:59.333
If you don't come out, we'll come in.

01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:03.625
Take him away. Grab him.

01:57:03.708 --> 01:57:05.000
Fine, all right.

01:57:07.541 --> 01:57:09.041
No, I'm not itchy!

01:57:09.125 --> 01:57:11.375
No, don't scratch...

01:57:45.708 --> 01:57:47.708
It's three billion in cash.

01:57:48.833 --> 01:57:51.916
Would you like to partner up?

01:57:55.375 --> 01:57:57.333
Holy shit...

01:58:00.416 --> 01:58:04.083
<i>Three billion in cash is fire.</i>

01:58:04.166 --> 01:58:05.208
Right?

01:58:06.041 --> 01:58:07.375
Fire, my ass.

01:58:07.916 --> 01:58:10.625
- Hold on...
- What's wrong with this?

01:58:12.375 --> 01:58:15.208
Fine! Let's do it!

01:58:15.291 --> 01:58:17.208
I'm done with snitching!

01:58:19.541 --> 01:58:20.541
<i>Hai!</i>

01:58:21.125 --> 01:58:23.291
- Kang-su!
- Yamamoto!

01:58:25.625 --> 01:58:28.208
Go! Let's move!

01:58:32.125 --> 01:58:33.250
What is it?

01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:35.250
- Who is it?
- Cops!

01:58:35.333 --> 01:58:36.541
Run!

01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:39.750
You snitched on us?

01:58:44.041 --> 01:58:45.375
Get that bastard!

01:59:01.166 --> 01:59:02.208
Shit!

01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:07.375
Bro!

01:59:09.125 --> 01:59:11.250
You think I'd run off on my own?

01:59:11.333 --> 01:59:12.333
No way!

01:59:12.833 --> 01:59:14.333
Put the gun down.

01:59:19.125 --> 01:59:20.458
Let's split it 50-50.

01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:23.750
Okay!

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:27.708
Let's go half-half.

01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:30.000
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

01:59:32.958 --> 01:59:35.125
Okay, 50-50!

01:59:49.833 --> 01:59:51.416
Bro, stop joking around.

01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:53.458
Shit, uncuff me!

01:59:55.083 --> 01:59:57.500
Come on, man! Bro!

01:59:57.583 --> 02:00:00.291
It's Daddy. Yes.
