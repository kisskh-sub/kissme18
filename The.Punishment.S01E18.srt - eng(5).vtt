chatting with Su.

What were you talking about?

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.590
Su was telling me his past adventures.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.380
They were so exciting and fun

Really?

The air's so dry.
I scratched and broke the skin.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.010
So much heat in your body, huh?

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:39.810
The weather is too dry.

We were planning to save them
for the New Year celebration.

We never expected
they would somehow catch fire.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.540
That works too.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.520
Consider it an early celebration.

as Gang and Hongbao know,

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.240
it was so close.
If I'd been a few minutes late,

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.640
we might've been
at the police station now.

Lately,

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.310
the police have been watching us closely.

If we continue fighting,

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.950
we won't make any money,

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.890
and we might end up in jail.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.000
I think it's really

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.190
not worth it.

to have a meal and drink with us.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.170
So, nothing is off the table.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.110

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.460

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.070
I'm the same.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.290
I have a brother too.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.180
A man should always
look out for his brothers.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.160
Unlike Ma Jin,

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.000
I hold nothing back from my brothers.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.640
But first,

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.090
you need to see me
as your brother, right?

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.140
After having this drink,

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.080
let's forget about the past.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.510

By the way,

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.440
From now on, you'll be fully in charge of

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.170
the debt collection business.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.350
Whatever you say.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.370
This is my own car.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:31.390
It's yours now.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.140
Later, I'll also

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:34.830
assign some men to assist you.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.110
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.510
Aren't your eyes tired?

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.100
How about this?

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.510
Come on.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.190
Are you happy now?

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.590
I've paid you back for that punch.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.720
If that's not enough, I'll do it again.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.750
As your brother said, we're family now.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.920
So, this is over.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.440
Can you let it go?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.530
Alright.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.720
Come on.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.310
Let's drink up.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.490
Tianye, drink up.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.770
Cheers. Cheers.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:41.880
Good.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.510
Eat meat

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.300
and drink wine.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:48.990
Today's matter is now

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.530
water under the bridge.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.880
Let's move on. Come on.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:00.590
Come on, brothers,

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.190
let's have a drink together.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:04.440
Muzhi,

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.320
do you really trust Su Hongbao?

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.400
Are you really going to use him?

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.500
I'm wondering

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.910
why Liu Tianye

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.100
tried so hard to persuade Su Hongbao

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.790
to join us.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.770
Why would he do that?

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.750
I'm the one asking.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.760
I'm full and sleepy.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.390
I can't protect you forever.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.250
If one day I'm gone,

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.720
what will you do?

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.570
Muzhi!

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.550
You're still here, aren't you?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.270
Just be honest with me.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.600
What exactly is he up to?

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.030
Look.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.270
Su Hongbao

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.060
is like a knife.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.490
No matter who's holding it,

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.500
it's just a knife.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.280
But Liu Tianye is different.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.400
Liu Tianye is just like us.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.110
He's got great ambition.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.020
He's obsessed with
getting a seat at the table.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.080
A seat at the table?

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.250
Whose table?

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.090
He wants to cooperate with Zhang Xin.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.300
Is he even capable of that?

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.630
Listen, remember this.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.440
Liu Tianye

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.429
killed Ma Jin.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.679
Ma Jin fell at his hands,

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.130
and we didn't help much, right?

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.810
Yes.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.679
So, keep this in mind.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.790
We must be

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.949
careful around Liu Tianye.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.820
We can't become the next Ma Jin.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.280
Got it?

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.440
Got it.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.679
Tianye, goodbye.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.610
Thanks.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.030
Tianye.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.030
How did it go with

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.290
He Biao and Su Hongbao?

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.830
We don't have much time left.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.940
Contact Uncle Limin and Chen Shuifa.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.420
I need to talk to Qiao Defu.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.840
Why do you want to see him?

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.480
What does he have to do with us?

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.740
Now I need to build a connection with him.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.800
He won the bid

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.090
for Hangang Center.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.310
Even Zhang Xin is out.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.290
Is Zhang Xin okay with that?

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:31.760
Of course not.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:32.920
That's why

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.480
this is our best opportunity.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.070
Do you mean

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.600
we should use
Qiao Defu's business at the port

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.030
to persuade Zhang Xin
to negotiate with the higher-ups?

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.990
Once I cooperate with Qiao Defu,

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.830
I'll have a seat at the table.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.440
And if we can get

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.170
some shares in Hangang Center,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.090
we'll have the stature
to negotiate with anyone.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.750
Will they even consider us?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.760
That's why we need to expand our business.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.230
Refined oil products are currently

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.230
the most profitable.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.290
Like I said before,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.280
we can buy some gas stations

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.680
to create a supply chain.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.150
We also need to speed up
the money laundering.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.880
The other day, I saw

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.610
a seafood restaurant for sale.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.000
It has high prices and big cash flows.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.330
I'll talk to them later.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.730
Tianye.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.030
This is pure gambling.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.330
What if we lose?

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.070
Do you have a backup plan?

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.090
Anyway, I've already risked everything.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.110
Lose?

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.810
If we lose,

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.960
we'll start over.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.630
If we lose,

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.470
we'll never get another chance.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.330
For this shipment,

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.490
I've left you a backup plan.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.030
The bullets will come
with the next shipment.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.710
Tianye,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.220
this is a real gun.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.000
This...

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.530
This is awesome.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:17.920
With this,

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.920
nobody will dare mess with us anymore!

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.670
Right?

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.190
Tianye.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.000
You need to think carefully
about how to use it.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.000
Thank you.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.760
I hope you never have to use it.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.670
Did you drink?

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.880
I drank with my clients.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.670
Don't let him smell it!

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.920
Tell me.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.560
Who were you drinking with?

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.590
Just some clients

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:35.840
and friends.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.320
Who was that person today?

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.840
Which one?

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.440
Which one? The one who dropped the hammer.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.590
Just a supplier.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.570
What kind of supplier
carries those things around?

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.420
He can't be a good guy.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.230
That guy...

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.640
just got out of jail.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.150
Just got out?

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:00.630
Wait,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.760
Liu Tianye, are you out of your mind?

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.510
Why would you associate
with someone like that?

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.920
Well,

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.400
when

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.150
doing business,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.630
you meet all sorts of people.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.430
But he's really not a bad person.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320
Not bad in nature.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.150
Anyway,

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.030
I'm okay.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:15.930
I'm back unharmed.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:17.090
Don't worry.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.540
If he were a bad guy,

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.150
would I be able to come back like this?

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.670
I wouldn't.

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:21.800
I was so worried.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.280
Don't worry. I mean it.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.070
I'm fine.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.550
It was a great day.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.680
I'm happy.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.820
Those things

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.490
I thought couldn't be done

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.830
all worked out today.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.760
I made it.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.770
I'm sorry.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.530
I know I'm not a good husband.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.230
I really do.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.630
I've been busy outside lately

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.030
and haven't taken care of

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.590
things at home.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.480
I haven't taken care of you.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.250
I'm so sorry.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.500
But honey,

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.480
I love you both.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.790
Thank you.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.140
I made it.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.120
Some things...

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.770
Even if I don't ask,

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.480
you need to tell me when necessary.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.820
Do you understand?

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.920
I do.

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.670
I've told you.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.070
When

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.210
this is

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.090
all settled,

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.150
I'll...

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.840
tell you

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.430
everything in detail,

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.760
okay?

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.000
Take a shower.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.760
Okay.

Liu Tianye contacted me.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.590
He resolved the issue with Su Hongbao.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.820

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.320
to give him a chance

he's very ambitious.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.240
He wants a seat at the table
just like He Biao does.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.550
Okay.
