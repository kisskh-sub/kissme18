00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.789
[Glory]

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.910
[Episode 7]

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.120
Marking the boat
won't find the lost sword.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.070
Fixed rules can't handle all changes.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.759
Sometimes, to get things done,

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.000
we servants

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.960
have to season the bland,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.350
or turn down the boil.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.680
We can't report every detail

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.940
to the steward in time.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.320
Please forgive me, Ms. Yan.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.720
How dare you talk so much?

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.870
Who gave you the guts

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.930
to be so disrespectful in front of me?

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.860
I did.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.030
Greetings, Miss Rong.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.630
Mrs. Yan,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.840
I asked him to attend the tea party.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.770
Don't blame him.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.030
Miss Rong,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.120
this man is just

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.650
a beggar of unknown origin.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.840
Favoring him like this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.960
will stir gossip.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.730
It might bring trouble.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.750
What?

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.079
If I choose to favor him,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.130
by what right do others dare question me?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.120
I spoke out of turn. Please forgive me.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.340
The swing rope in my courtyard is broken.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.350
I can fix it today.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.680
So aren't you coming?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.360
Not only is the rope broken,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.800
but the wooden seat
is also rotten with age.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.960
But it's nothing serious.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.930
In about two hours,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.680
I can make

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.610
a new one for you.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.590
The old one has its charm.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.120
No need to bother making a new one.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.380
Just replace the rope.

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.760
Well... Miss Rong, this is...

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.840
I'd like to

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.300
ask you for another favor.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.280
You come from a noble house,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.680
with everyone at your call.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.750
What else could you possibly

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.840
need my help with?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.360
As you know,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.990
my cousin

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.850
is a man with no schemes.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.390
You can rest assured, Miss Rong.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.640
I won't forget what I've promised.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.110
I will do my utmost to protect him.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.760
Today I made you dress up for the feast.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.470
I also showed you great favor

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.690
and praised you repeatedly.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.079
You're smart.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.420
You should understand my true intention.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.360
I got it.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.190
I've been risking my life for him,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.430
but you still don't think it's enough.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.920
Now you want me

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.159
to be his shield?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.420
For him, I get slandered, envied,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.560
take the hits, open and hidden,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.480
face various danger..

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.159
All because he is

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.159
your cousin,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.580
he gets your protection,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.000
while someone like me, with no background

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.750
and low status, should just go die?

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.150
Am I not born from parents

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.120
who can also feel suffering and pain?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.270
Haven't I risked my life for you,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.040
Miss Rong?

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.850
For the sake of your childhood cousin,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.920
you'd just stand by

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.520
and watch me walk to my death?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.360
Enough with the life and death talk.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.620
You're overstepping.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.630
If it weren't for

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.720
Miss Rong's kindness in saving people,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.720
you think you'd survive till today?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.450
I'll repay your kindness one day,

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.560
Miss Rong,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.800
but in this way.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.830
If that's all,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.890
I'll take my leave.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720
Stop right there!

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.200
I will fix the swing,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.260
you can rest assured, Miss Rong.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.240
Damn it!

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.120
Miss Rong!

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.120
The Rong family has more than

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.180
just him to rely on.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.360
Without him,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.159
can't I get things done?

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.810
You there.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.159
This swing was personally built

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.830
by Mr. Wen for Miss Rong.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.850
Please be careful with it.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.970
Old things have their charm.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.600
No need to bother making a new one.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.860
Just replace the rope.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.540
I recognized your footsteps.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.480
You're that scholar named Bai.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.270
If you were like me,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.720
relying only on your hearing for years

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.450
to distinguish subtle sounds,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.680
you would know that

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.480
no two footsteps sound the same.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.360
I came specifically

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.820
to thank you, Lady Yunshu.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.780
Thank you for your guidance
at the tea party.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.080
Come closer.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.950
Even closer, please.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.950
What are you smelling, Lady Yunshu?

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.870
There's a scent on you.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.390
It's the stench of ink
accumulated over years

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.120
from copying books for others.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.000
What?

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.160
Aren't you offended by what I said?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.510
I did make my living
by copying books for others,

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.270
which earned me the headmaster's favor.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.310
Later I was exempted from tuition fees

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.970
and recommended to come here.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.870
Being born poor isn't my fault.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.270
There's nothing to be angry about.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.680
Yunyin is very upset.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.110
She sent you invitations twice,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.840
both politely declined by you.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.680
I just heard your footsteps

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680
hesitating,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.280
not daring to approach.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.830
Is there any concern?

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.390
To speak frankly,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.430
the Rong family has many people
and much gossip.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.630
I fear provoking idle talk and trouble.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.750
We sisters are all at marriageable age.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.270
You fear getting close

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.830
might spark romantic rumors,

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.310
private entanglements and karma,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.920
which will ruin your reputation
and prospects.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.250
You're truly pedantic.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.260
But you worry too much.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.970
In this lifetime,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.950
I would absolutely
never take a poor scholar

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.870
as my husband.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.890
Absolutely never.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.650
I've expressed my thanks. I should go now.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.160
Years ago, my mom and her parents

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.960
fled from the north as refugees.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.120
The whole family crowded into a small,

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.850
low-roofed shack in Nanxiawa.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.390
You were able

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.840
to find copying work to do,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.570
but she could only sell herself

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.870
to enter the Rong Mansion

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.200
as a lowly maid.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.360
So our conversations

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.360
won't attract unwanted attention.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.360
Because everyone knows

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.850
that I, a little blind girl,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.840
want to firmly plant my roots

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.390
in these tea hills,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.200
can only seek a helpful husband

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.800
from families like Yang or He

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.670
to please grandmother,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.270
and gain a better position
in this family.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.080
So...

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.630
So we can talk

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.910
anytime,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.790
anything,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.550
and in any way.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.380
After all, you're tactful and likable.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.630
If I were Shanbao,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.940
lacking neither gold nor silver,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.030
possessing both status and position,

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.440
and all I lacked was an interesting person

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.500
to keep my company,

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.520
I would definitely choose you.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.720
Thank you for your kind words,
Lady Yunshu.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.790
But your Rong family
seeks a matrilocal husband,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.650
not a playmate.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.870
Then you're quite mistaken.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.150
A son-in-law in the Rong family,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.600
apart from continuing the bloodline,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.060
is nothing but a playmate.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.960
It can only be

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.000
mutual respect and emotionally distant.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.960
If one day

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.990
Shanbao develops true feelings,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.840
then you'd be in danger.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.150
The way you put it,

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.420
the Rong family truly
is a dangerous place.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.890
You really know how to joke.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:08.910
A joke?

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.390
Yes, it's a joke.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.670
And I

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.070
cannot only joke around,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.600
but also help you.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.220
Yeju.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.050
Lady Yunshu.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.200
I lost my grip.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.000
Yeju,

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.000
show Mr. Bai the way.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.270
Let him get changed

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.870
Going back like this is hardly proper.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.320
Yes.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.480
Everything has its order of precedence

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.070
and degrees of intimacy.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.890
They grew up together,

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.150
with deep feelings for each other.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.550
She wants to protect him.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.370
That's only human nature.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.600
Nothing to fault.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.420
And what are you, then?

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.130
Do you really expect her
to care about you?

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.200
There's no business in this world
that can't be discussed.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200
If she wants your help

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.150
with that matter,

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.790
she'll surely reward you well.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.320
What are you so angry about?

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.920
Who let you lose your temper like that!

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.390
Idiot!

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.070
This way, Mr. Bai.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.960
Their business

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.280
has nothing to do with me.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.140
I'll ignore it.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.370
Maybe I should go check it out anyway.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.430
Everyone, come and see

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.510
who's hiding

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.510
in here.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.280
Lady Yunyin,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.270
how could there be

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.550
a lady who peeps at men changing clothes?

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.630
Have you no shame?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.010
Give me back my clothes now.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.780
I've shown you my affection
multiple times,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.850
but you didn't want my respect.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.870
So why should I save your reputation?

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.750
Of course I'll invite everyone

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.840
to come and see

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.650
how thick your skin really is.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.240
Well?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.440
No matter how high and mighty,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.240
how cunning and sly you think you are,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.900
you still ended up in my hands.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.270
Yunshu,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.320
you really have a way.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.670
With only few words,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.150
you vented the anger on my behalf.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.360
A liar with full of lies.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.890
I shouldn't have trusted you.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.700
Mr. Bai,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.790
I advise you

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.320
to quickly kowtow to Yunyin

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.900
and admit your mistake.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.120
Otherwise, if she really gets angry,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.150
and throws you out on the street naked,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.940
or tells everyone you stripped

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.670
and harassed the Rong's maid,

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.550
the consequences would be unimaginable.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.870
That's right. Kowtow.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.600
Kowtow. Do it now.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.880
Once you kowtow, all will be forgiven.
Hurry up.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.650
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.790
Kowtow!
Why are you just standing there?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.480
Faster!
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.000
Kowtow now! Quickly!

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.410
That's right. Kowtow!

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.130
Kowtow now!

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.510
The spring air is still chilly.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.640
Mr. Bai,
please take care of yourself.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.840
Who asked you to meddle?

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.810
Lady Yunyin,

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.630
if Miss Rong were to learn of this,

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.000
it might not be wise.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.880
Don't use her to intimidate me.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.200
Tie him up too.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.510
Strip him naked
and throw him at the front gate.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.550
I want to see

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.390
if Rong Shanbao

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.520
will turn against me

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.790
for this servant.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.430
Look outside, please.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.640
Rong Yunyin, how impressive you are.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.560
Only you get to choose personally.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.820
Does that mean I can't?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.790
How stingy.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.960
If he were willing,

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.690
I wouldn't even care.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.720
But he's unwilling now,

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.870
and you're forcing yourself on him.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.270
Are you a highway robber

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.960
or a vicious murderer?

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.600
Since when did the Rong family

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.150
teach you to treat guests like this?

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.270
You're arrogant and provoking trouble.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.390
If Grandmother hears of this tomorrow,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.200
I guarantee you won't

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.860
set foot in the tea plantation
this year either.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.660
As if I care!

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.620
Even pork ribs
are better-looking than him.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.730
What's a man afraid of being seen for?

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.440
Can't even take a little joke.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.320
I'm leaving.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.390
Shanbao, you'd better be careful.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.620
If he's so afraid of being seen,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.120
he must have hidden sores.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.670
You're slandering me!

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.110
Let's go.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.120
Calm down.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.720
Getting angry is exactly what she wants.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.390
She'll claim even more
that you have a disease.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.440
Shanbao, it was Yunyin who...

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.080
I...

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.180
It's alright. I don't blame you.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.720
Just don't follow her
into mischief again.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.230
Mr. Bai, Yunyin was rude and offensive.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.550
Let me escort you back
to Xinfang Pavilion.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.110
Thank you, Miss Rong.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.360
And as your friend,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.760
I can not only joke around

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.150
but also help you.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.000
This time,
he could turn misfortune and disaster

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
into blessing,

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.400
he should thank you as the matchmaker.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.280
Mr. Lu,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.290
you really are a good person.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.240
Yunyin has been spoiled by Grandmother
since childhood.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.030
She acts recklessly
and speaks without restraint.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.400
I appreciate your tolerance
and generosity

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.590
for not taking offense
at a young girl's behavior.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.650
I thank you on Grandmother's behalf.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.780
Don't worry, Miss Rong.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.240
Today's matter will not be spread from me,

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.960
nor will it

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.710
tarnish the Rong family's reputation.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.880
Let me serve the tea.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.510
Mr. Bai,

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.540
Lady Rong just sent a doctor

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.400
to examine all the young masters

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.460
for a health check.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.540
Lady Rong...

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.250
I suppose Lady Yunyin

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.000
went back and exaggerated everything,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.720
shifting the blame onto you.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.400
Lady Rong, misled by slander,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.200
now seeks medical examination.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.720
Given the situation,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.250
you should return quickly,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.070
lest outsiders say

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.070
you fled the scene

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:09.750
and confirm

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.010
the slander
of hidden sores or ailments.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.600
Miss Rong,

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.110
I concede today's game of chess.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.180
Another day,
I'll seek your guidance again.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.440
See you, Mr. Bai.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.030
How dare you fabricate orders!

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.240
There was indeed a doctor today,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.230
coming to do health checks.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:43.230
I didn't deliberately deceive him.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.720
However,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.920
if you're looking for a substitute,

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.500
I don't think Mr. Bai is suitable.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.360
I'd like to hear the reason.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.790
He is adaptable

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.480
to changing circumstances.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.340
Unfortunately, he's too clever.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.720
He avoids conflict when he can,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.780
lacking courage and determination.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.110
Just like in this chess game,

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.600
he clearly had chances to win,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.110
but he

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.830
feared you wouldn't be pleased

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.070
and was constantly hesitating,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.160
unable to make a decision.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.820
In his eyes,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.350
you're just someone

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.570
who would get upset over losing a game.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.910
What kind of person does he take you for?

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.160
He's a man
who hides and conceals before you.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.000
He's too afraid

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.330
to show his true nature.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.630
Don't you find him boring, Miss Rong?

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.360
If he's boring,
what makes you interesting?

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.480
He lacks courage,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.740
but you have boldness?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.380
You clearly rejected me outright before,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.480
yet now you came and changed your mind.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.550
As a person who goes back on his word

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.970
and changes sides without remorse,

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.230
why should I trust you?

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.000
Because I understand your thoughts

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.640
more thoroughly than he does.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.200
Because I can

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.480
complete any task you assign

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.880
with perfect execution.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.240
Because I

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.720
won this chess game today.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.480
What do you want?

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.550
Being your beloved one

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.030
is like pulling chestnuts from the fire.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.690
It's a dangerous task indeed.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.450
What's in it for me?

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.820
I won't just guide you, lost lamb, home.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.510
I'll find out

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.040
who really wanted you dead.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.910
I'll ward off disasters for you,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.040
and make sure you come to no harm.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.460
Is that enough?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.720
Yes, that's enough.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.650
Miss Rong, you're truly generous.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.840
But… when you
stroll in the garden with a man,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.970
it's always just chess, cards, or tea.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.850
Going in circles in this little patch.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.240
If you try to pass that off

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.680
as a lovers' tryst…

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.290
Well, nobody would buy it.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.290
So what do you suggest?

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.150

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.220

until you scared the soul

right out of me!

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.590
Miss Rong,
since you need to talk with Mr. Wen,

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.850
I'll take my leave now.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.160
Shanbao, you're usually

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.310
not one for such playful activities.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.000
What possessed you
to swing so recklessly today?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.130
Just a passing whim.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.280
What made you here today?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.130
[Rong Mansion]

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.550
Lu Fusheng!

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.010
What makes you so cheerful?

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.000
Everyone in the household

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.420
is busy preparing
for the Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.950
I instructed you yesterday

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.350
to gather everyone listed

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.880
on the roster early this morning

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.110
to receive my assignments.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.030
Did my words just vanish into thin air?

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.890
Steward Cheng,

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.880
with hundreds of souls
in the Rong Mansion,

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.310
isn't that enough for you to command?

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.000
On my first day here,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.980
I made myself perfectly clear.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.920
I stayed only out of gratitude

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.030
for Miss Rong saving my life,

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:42.790
nothing more.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.350
You can give those ceremonial duties, .

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.550
the offerings, the tea service

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.610
to anyone you like.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.570
I only answer to Qilan Garden.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.110
I can't be bothered
with such trivial matters.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.110
Outrageous!

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.830
If Miss Rong knew about

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.160
your insolent remarks,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.500
she'd be the first to punish you.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.820
Go ahead and tell her then.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.160
I'm busy

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.680
making a kite for Bao.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.740
No time for your chatter.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.030
How dare you call Miss Rong 's nick name!

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.400
'Willow twigs for thread,
catkin for cotton spun,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.790
A thousand lengths
to fly the paper kite begun.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.690
How much of
the spring breeze's strength is spent,

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.690
To carry the young ones
to the heavens, heaven-sent?'

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.770
Mr. Yang, what are you doing here?

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.400
The person who fought me

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.240
at the martial arts arena that day
was you, wasn't it?

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.840
Mr. Yang, you must be joking.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.720
A mere servant like me

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.250
wouldn't be worthy
of the martial arts arena.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.830
It was Mr. Wen who bested you.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.890
Don't block my way.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.240
What exactly do you want?

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.030
To have a rematch, of course.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.860
Steward Cheng!

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.650
Steward Cheng!

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.830
Just listen to this!

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.450
What nonsense is he talking?

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.160
A real man stands firm
between heaven and earth.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.280
His word is his bond.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:56.920
How can someone lose

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.380
and then demand a rematch?

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.350
The sheer gall!

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.070
Come on, explain this to me.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.680
Be my witness!

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.960
A real man would never do anything

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.680
sneaky

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.240
or underhanded.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.030
If you win,

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.930
win with honor,

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.760
so others truly accept defeat.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.920
No, you can't agree.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.270
You can't accept this.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.590
Do not engage in private fights!

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.900
If you're too scared to fight,

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.650
then pack and get out of the Rong family.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.130
Fine, let's have this contest.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.150
I'm not afraid of you.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.480
Good.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.680
Tomorrow at noon,

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.440
I'll wait for you in the bamboo grove
behind the hill.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.960
Mr. Bai, please

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.000
be our witness.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.170
Everyone in the Rong family

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.340
knows your affair with Miss Rong.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:26.960
Also,

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.670
knowing how jealous he is,

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.270
you should have avoided him.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.240
How can you knowingly

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.130
walk into a dead end

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.730
and fight this battle alone?

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.110
Mr. Bai, thank you for saying these to me.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.590
It makes saving you worthwhile.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:43.490
You...

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.030
you're really going to die.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.900
You'll die!

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.430
You all drink and gamble,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.830
only to send me here to sharpen swords?

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.750
Black-hearted bullies picking on the weak!

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.550
Eating meat only to get the runs!

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.400
Well, well,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.400
I've caught you now.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.940
Oh, it's Brother Chang.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.470
You scared me half to death.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.970
We're from the same hometown.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.620
How could I shortchange you?

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.970
You really look out for me.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.640
Go dig in.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.350
I'll do your work for you.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.880
I won't let you get scolded.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:35.680
Okay.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:10.590
Young Master.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.510
Not bad.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.440
Truly worthy of being
a trusted aide

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.170
to Miss Rong.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.630
You're quite clever and careful.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.850
Miss Rong repeatedly instructed me

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.180
to take good care of you.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.960
If anything happens to you,

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.640
I couldn't bear the punishment.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.970
Did she really say that?

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.160
I guess she's not that heartless.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:44.600
Mr. Lu,

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:45.790
things are extremely urgent now,

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.680
how can you still sit here so calmly?

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.450
I'll go inform Miss Rong right away.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:49.980
No hurry.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.550
When you see Miss Rong,

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.680
what do you plan to tell her?

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.880
The truth, of course.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.000
When you see her,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.920
don't mention a single word

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.450
about what happened today.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.720
You may only tell her

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.510
that I've accepted the challenge.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.240
Tomorrow I will fight that Yang fellow

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.550
to the death.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.520
No matter how much I pleaded,

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.120
Mr. Lu wouldn't listen.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.640
Once the weather changes,

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.350
all his old wounds

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.480
hurt him to the bone.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.460
He's no match for Mr. Yang.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.770
I'm going out for a walk.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.510
He is quite odd.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.960
Tomorrow's contest
is a matter of life and death.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.420
He came here at this moment

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.310
surely for something important.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.440
Why stop at the door without coming in?

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.200
No, you can't.

You can't fight with him.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.510
Yang Dingchen has incredible strength

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:16.720
and ruthless techniques.

Last time you got lucky,

but in a real fight,

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.790
your life would be at risk.

Just listen to me.

It's my fault.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.750
You're still recovering
from your injuries.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.680
Why trouble yourself to come here?

that Miss Rong bestowed upon you.

It's one of a kind in the world.

If you truly liked him,

you should have told Grandmother early on.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.800
She wouldn't have refused you.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.860
Was it worth resorting
to such despicable means,

You're the Fourth Young Lady

Why do you act more recklessly
as you grow older?

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.290
I've always been straightforward,

You'd argue that the dead are alive!

So you're saying that
by testing him for Shanbao,

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.030
you are not at fault
but actually deserve credit?

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.670

right and wrong like this?

to gain experience at the tea plantation,

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.230

so many problems.

still houses the He family.

We must be more careful in the future.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.280
Just listen.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.000

asking me not to blame you.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.320
As for those in Xinfang Pavilion,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.920
if there's anyone you fancy,

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.000
she would never compete with her sisters.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.800
Personal feelings
don't cloud her judgment.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.360
She puts the Rong family
above everything else.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.880
That's the demeanor
of a true head of household.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.340
You should learn from her.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.150
The order of seniority and respect
must not be disturbed.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.030
On the day of
the Tea Ancestor Festival Ceremony,

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.190
Bao will surely choose a worthy husband.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.360
Afterward, you may choose as you wish.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.230
If any of you dare cause another scandal
and become a laughingstock,

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.160
I will be the first to not spare you!

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.070
Copy 'The Classic of Tea' 100 times

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.400
before you see me again.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.310
Grandmother.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.840
Grandmother.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.760
Putting on an act

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.550
of being a kind and generous elder sister.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.480
So you already came to Grandmother

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.830
to poison her against me.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.290
Now you must be satisfied.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.360
You're incompetent yourself,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.690
yet full of complaints.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.320
You brought this shame upon yourself.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.720
How can you blame others?

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.370
I'd rather marry a poor scholar

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:09.190
than someone who fancies a lowly servant!

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.980
If we ever share a table in the future,

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.090
should he call us masters,

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.440
or should we call him brother-in-law?

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.150
Shanbao,

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.470
you really aren't picky at all.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.070
Master or servant,

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.810
it's all up to me.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.440
Yunyin, if you have time

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.480
for idle gossip,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.400
you'd better go back to your copying.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.200
You'll probably be working
until midnight today.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.180
You...

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.110
Miss Rong.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.240
Miss Rong, something's happened to Mr. Lu.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.990
Enough.
Aren't you embarrassed enough already?

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.440
Let her go.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.880
Yunyin, I'll grind the ink for you.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.060
Get lost!

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:16.840
Miss Rong.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:22.320
Shanbao.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.360
Miss Rong, why are you here?

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.000
This is not the place you should be.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.100
Mr. Bai, why didn't you stop her?

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.360
Miss Rong.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.230
Fortunately,
he was wearing body armor today,

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.430
so the vital organs weren't injured.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:41.400
However,
the wound looks quite frightening,

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.920
better not look at it.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:56.460
What are you standing there for?

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.590
Hurry and change the medicinal cloth.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.700
The sword was poisoned?

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.440
Yes.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:14.760
The sword was laced with arsenic

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.620
and monkshood.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.730
If I had arrived even a bit later,

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.280
the one lying on the bed

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.610
would be a corpse by now.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.030
This assailant's intentions
were truly vicious.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.710
Shanbao, don't be upset yet.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.230
Yang Dingchen is too proud of his status,

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.590
so he'll certainly deny everything.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.320
We must handle this carefully.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.030
Where is Cheng Guanyu?

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.140
Tell him to personally

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.510
invite Mr. Yang here.
