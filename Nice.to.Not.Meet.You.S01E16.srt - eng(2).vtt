00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:11.385
I've been holding onto this case
for a long time,

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:13.762
and I want to get to the bottom of it.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:18.684
Set up an interview for me.

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:20.936
Make sure the interview
is on a reputable program

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.606
that will give our story real credibility.

00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:36.785
Hi, I'm here.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.703
Yeah.

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:41.332
Why are you here at this hour, though?
Did something happen?

00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:43.500
You said to call if I needed your help.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:47.087
What is it?

00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:49.048
What do you need my help with?

00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:50.090
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.803
Let's take him down.

00:01:57.264 --> 00:01:58.223
Together.

YTM NEWS LIVE BROADCAST

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:08.317
We'll wrap up the pre-interview here.

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:13.489
It's my first time on live news,
so I'm really nervous.

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:15.991
The anchor will make you feel at ease.

00:02:18.285 --> 00:02:19.286
By the way, ma'am.

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:22.498
Can I ask you a favor?

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:24.124
If we release this…

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:27.461
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na
are the faces of the company.

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:28.712
Won't they take a hit?

00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:30.506
I assume they have
shares in the company too.

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.299
They won't be able to
avoid a hit entirely.

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:36.178
But for now, I've taken
the best possible measures.

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:38.305
Actually,

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.557
I'm more concerned for Mr. Lee.

00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:43.686
Are you sure about this?

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:50.192
It does weigh on me,

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:52.736
but I've decided it's something I must do,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.572
so I'm willing to take any risk necessary.

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:59.118
Then let's run this article as it is.

00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:03.080
Oh, also…

00:03:03.163 --> 00:03:05.499
I wanted to express my gratitude
to both of you.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.085
Thank you.

00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.005
YTM LIVE NEWS BROADCAST

00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:47.166
I went for a solemn look today.

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:51.378
Well, this is my solemn look.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.963
Oh, yeah?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.798
I'm going to say

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:56.717
some solemn things today.

00:03:58.635 --> 00:04:00.512
-Get ready for standby.
-Okay.

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:02.890
Shall we go?

00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:05.309
You're watching our star interview
on YTM News.

00:04:05.392 --> 00:04:06.894
Lim Hyeon-jun and Gwon Se-na from

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:09.563
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu
are here with us today.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:11.023
It's nice to meet you both.

00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:12.316
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:14.401
I'm Lim Hyeon-jun,

00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:16.612
and I play Kang Pil-gu
in Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:18.655
Hello.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.158
I'm Gwon Se-na, and I play Seo I-su

00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:23.285
in season five
of Good Detective Kang Pil-gu.

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:24.703
All right.

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:29.875
It's ready to go.

00:04:36.507 --> 00:04:38.467
[EXCLUSIVE] THE UGLY TRUTH
BEHIND ENTERTAINMENT MOGUL LEE DAE-HO

00:04:38.842 --> 00:04:40.135
PUBLISH REQUEST SENT!

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.472
The last question is for you, Mr. Lim.

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:47.101
What do you think
Kang Pil-gu from season five

00:04:47.184 --> 00:04:49.269
has taught you?

00:04:50.187 --> 00:04:52.648
Kang Pil-gu always made the right choices

00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:54.316
and never regretted them.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.193
From now on,

00:04:56.276 --> 00:05:00.030
I want to live
just as sincerely and confidently.

00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:03.117
Ms. Gwon, I hear that you have

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.495
something important to share
with our viewers today.

00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:10.999
Yes.

00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:16.130
The truth is--

00:05:16.213 --> 00:05:17.047
Wait.

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:19.591
May I go first?

00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:22.594
Let's do that, then.

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:27.182
A few months ago,
Ms. Gwon's agency merged with mine.

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:30.227
Many people hoped
the integration would be beneficial,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.645
and I hoped the same.

00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:32.980
But I recently found out

00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:35.149
that Chairman Lee Dae-ho of Eunseong Group

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:36.942
has been using our agency

00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:40.279
as a means to launder money.

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:45.075
I apologize for raising an issue like this
during our drama promotion segment.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.327
But as a co-production partner
on Kang Pil-gu,

00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:49.037
I've invited a guest today

00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:51.999
to shed more light
on the details of this case.

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:19.693
Hello.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.155
I'm Reporter Wi Jeong-sin
from Sports Eunseong.

00:06:24.698 --> 00:06:27.242
I'm here today

00:06:27.993 --> 00:06:31.246
to expose the ugly truth
behind the political and business circles.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.873
This case traces back seven years,

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:36.376
to the death of an assemblyman's aide.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.961
Chairman Lee Dae-ho of Eunseong Group

00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:40.255
-put company funds in an illegal PE fund.
-Damn it!

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.299
And in order to obtain information on
the Cheongwon City redevelopment project,

00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:44.301
he solicited favors from Ha Gee-wan,

00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:46.762
a former assemblyman
and the current FSS director.

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:48.972
FINALE

00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:01.109
Everything will be okay.

00:07:01.902 --> 00:07:02.861
I'll see you on the set.

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:12.537
You know, I came here today

00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:13.914
ready to expose everything.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:17.834
That's bold of you.

00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:20.003
Chairman Lee Dae-ho

00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:22.256
will stay out of sight for a while.

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:26.426
Things will get quite messy for some time.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.761
I'm ready for it,

00:07:27.844 --> 00:07:29.388
so you should brace yourself.

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:33.392
Well, both of you.

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:38.522
Oh, by the way…

00:07:39.731 --> 00:07:40.691
Thank you.

00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:04.464
You did great.

00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:08.302
I'm kind of worried, though,

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:10.304
now that your face has been exposed.

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.682
I know, right?

00:08:14.558 --> 00:08:17.185
Everyone saw my pretty face
on live national TV.

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:18.645
I'm sure it caused a stir.

00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:22.983
What? I'm serious.

00:08:25.027 --> 00:08:26.987
I'm more worried about you, though.

00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:29.906
We did all that
while Kang Pil-gu is still on air.

00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:33.160
You're talking to Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.663
I'm Kang Pil-gu, the symbol of justice.

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:46.131
We did the right thing today.

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:49.092
People will acknowledge it.

00:08:53.764 --> 00:08:54.598
Shall we go?

00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:07.069
[EXCLUSIVE] THE UGLY TRUTH
BEHIND ENTERTAINMENT MOGUL LEE DAE-HO

00:09:07.152 --> 00:09:08.570
7 YEARS OF CORRUPTION
TIED TO BORROWED-NAME PROPERTY

00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:11.865
EUNSEONG GROUP CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO
ARRESTED FOR ILLEGAL PE FUND

00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:14.159
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO ARRESTED
IS THIS THE FALL OF EUNSEONG GROUP?

00:09:14.242 --> 00:09:17.245
TURMOIL IN THE EUNSEONG FAMILY,
ALL EYES ON WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL

00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:19.748
Hey, it's Chairman Lee Dae-ho!

00:09:23.043 --> 00:09:25.128
Do you admit to the allegations
made so far?

00:09:27.297 --> 00:09:29.299
-Do you feel any remorse?
-Anything to say to the public?

00:09:29.383 --> 00:09:31.259
Any comment
on the prosecution's investigation?

00:09:31.343 --> 00:09:33.637
Can we get a statement?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.680
Do you have any comments on the slush fund

00:09:35.764 --> 00:09:37.599
tied to the Cheongwon City
redevelopment project?

00:09:43.146 --> 00:09:46.274
Lim Hyeon-jun helped this woman
expose Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

00:09:46.358 --> 00:09:49.069
During a Kang Pil-gu season five
promotion segment, no less.

00:09:49.152 --> 00:09:51.029
Now, why do you think
he helped this woman?

00:10:02.749 --> 00:10:06.253
Remember when Lim Hyeon-jun said
he liked someone at the press conference?

00:10:06.336 --> 00:10:07.879
Everyone was barking up the wrong tree

00:10:07.963 --> 00:10:09.714
when it was really Wi Jeong-sin all along.

00:10:09.798 --> 00:10:13.468
Does that mean she used her boyfriend
to take down Chairman Lee?

00:10:13.552 --> 00:10:15.178
Not just the chairman.

00:10:15.262 --> 00:10:17.931
Kang Pil-gu and Gwon Se-na
both took a hit.

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:20.517
I heard Lim Hyeon-jun faces billions
in penalties for breaking ad contracts.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.769
Man, he's done for now.

00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:25.689
Wi Jeong-sin is the only one
who benefited from it all.

00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:26.815
She got an exclusive,

00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:28.817
made a name for herself,
and even has Mr. Lee in her corner.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.111
So none of you knew about this?

00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:32.154
Of course not.

00:10:32.237 --> 00:10:34.072
Wow, she's really something.

00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:49.379
Can you ring me up?

00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.755
Sure thing.

00:10:52.007 --> 00:10:53.300
Excuse me.

00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:54.968
Can I take that?

00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:58.430
Sure, go ahead.

00:11:14.154 --> 00:11:15.030
LIM HYEON-JUN, SIGNATURE

00:11:17.657 --> 00:11:18.909
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

00:11:29.503 --> 00:11:32.631
You're Kang Pil-gu, right?

00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:35.175
Yes, that's me.

00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:41.389
Seeing how you're
putting the building up for a quick sale,

00:11:41.473 --> 00:11:43.016
I take it you need cash quickly.

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:47.020
Yes, I guess so.

00:11:59.074 --> 00:12:00.575
Stop polishing it.

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:03.245
The car's already sold,
so what are you shining it up for?

00:12:03.328 --> 00:12:07.541
Come on, if it looks nice and pretty,
the new owner will treat it better.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.334
This is so frustrating.

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:11.753
Hey, enough with the sighing.

00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:13.255
It's my car I'm selling, not yours!

00:12:13.338 --> 00:12:14.965
And it's my building
I'm selling, not yours.

00:12:15.048 --> 00:12:18.260
Did Ms. Wi know things would get this bad
when she started all this?

00:12:18.343 --> 00:12:21.930
How many times do I have to tell you
I'm the one who asked her to go on TV?

00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:22.931
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:24.808
You're not a reporter, she is.

00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:27.394
Thanks to that damn live broadcast,

00:12:27.477 --> 00:12:29.104
our company got raided,

00:12:29.187 --> 00:12:31.982
and you had to sell your building and car
to cover the ad contract penalties!

00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:34.776
And what about Kang Pil-gu now?

00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:39.281
Jeez, if people enjoy Kang Pil-gu,
the ratings will bounce back.

00:12:39.364 --> 00:12:43.034
And the ad deals will come back
once my public image is restored.

00:12:45.245 --> 00:12:48.498
It won't be long
before people find out the truth.

00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:51.084
I'm sure of it.

00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:56.256
Why couldn't you just wait until
the drama was over to release the article?

00:12:56.339 --> 00:12:57.632
Why do it while it's still airing?

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.343
The ratings are low as they are.

00:13:00.427 --> 00:13:02.137
Why couldn't you just promote it
like you were told?

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.847
Hey, it did help promote the show.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.806
It caused a buzz, no?

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:05.849
No.

00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:07.475
Oh, really?

00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:13.607
Why didn't you talk him out of it, Ms. Wi?

00:13:15.483 --> 00:13:18.528
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can say.

00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:21.740
How's…

00:13:22.574 --> 00:13:23.825
Mr. Lim doing?

00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:25.243
He's going through a lot.

00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:27.495
He's selling off his building and car

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:29.080
and took out a mortgage on his home

00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:31.583
to pay the penalties
for breaking his ad contracts.

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:34.294
Are the penalties that steep?

00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:37.005
With that being said,

00:13:37.088 --> 00:13:39.090
about the article you promised to release.

00:13:39.174 --> 00:13:40.842
Could you get it out as soon as possible?

00:13:43.178 --> 00:13:44.971
Article releases are all about timing.

00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:47.891
If we release it immediately,

00:13:47.974 --> 00:13:51.019
people will accuse Mr. Lim
of trying to avoid responsibility.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:54.981
I suggest we hold off and publish it
when things are at their worst.

00:13:55.649 --> 00:13:57.317
That way, public opinion
will turn dramatically.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.443
Will it, though?

00:13:58.526 --> 00:14:00.320
Money is one thing.

00:14:00.403 --> 00:14:02.989
But his public image as an actor
has taken too much of a hit,

00:14:03.073 --> 00:14:05.033
and he's no longer getting
any new project offers.

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:06.117
At this rate,

00:14:06.201 --> 00:14:08.703
we might just end up
running a print shop again.

00:14:15.502 --> 00:14:17.212
He's selling off his building and car

00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:18.672
and took out a mortgage on his home

00:14:18.755 --> 00:14:20.382
to pay the penalties
for breaking his ad contracts.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.988
[EUNSEONGILBO] RECRUITMENT NOTICE:
SERIA TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT

00:14:48.993 --> 00:14:51.037
How are you holding up, Ms. Wi?

00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:53.164
Yes, I'm fine.

00:14:53.248 --> 00:14:55.875
Everyone's asking to confirm
your relationship with Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:14:55.959 --> 00:14:59.045
In fact, why don't you let us
write about your dating rumor?

00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:00.672
I know I'll do a good job.

00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:01.881
Jeez.

00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:02.966
What?

00:15:06.469 --> 00:15:07.345
Mr. Lee.

00:15:08.304 --> 00:15:11.015
I saw the Seria
temporary assignment notice.

00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:12.142
Has the position been filled?

00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:15.270
No, I believe no one has applied yet.

00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:17.647
Then I'll go.

00:15:17.731 --> 00:15:19.232
-What?
-No, you can't do that.

00:15:19.315 --> 00:15:22.110
If you're worried about
going straight to the political desk--

00:15:22.193 --> 00:15:24.028
It has nothing to do with that.

00:15:24.612 --> 00:15:25.989
It's fine if I never go back.

00:15:26.072 --> 00:15:28.074
Then why do you insist on going
to that dangerous place?

00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:32.495
If I let things go on like this,

00:15:33.163 --> 00:15:36.499
everyone will assume all the rumors
about Mr. Lim are true.

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:39.210
The dating rumor will break out
no matter what we do,

00:15:39.294 --> 00:15:42.589
and Chairman Lee Dae-ho's case
will get overshadowed and ignored.

00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:44.674
It may never fully come to light.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.386
You both know that the media
is already trying to spin this.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.680
Even so, you going to Seria

00:15:50.764 --> 00:15:52.766
won't resolve anything.

00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:53.683
You're right.

00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:57.479
But it'll at least shut down
the dating rumor.

00:15:57.979 --> 00:15:58.980
That way,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.858
things will settle faster.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.677
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

00:16:34.265 --> 00:16:36.184
Why is it so hard to get hold of you?

00:16:36.726 --> 00:16:37.560
Is something wrong?

00:16:38.436 --> 00:16:40.522
You have it worse than I do, Mr. Lim.

00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:44.108
I heard filming has resumed.

00:16:44.818 --> 00:16:45.985
Aren't you busy?

00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:48.154
Exactly. I'm the one who's busy,

00:16:48.238 --> 00:16:50.907
so why is it so hard to reach you?

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.866
I'm sorry.

00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:54.202
Do you have some time?

00:16:55.203 --> 00:16:56.412
Of course, I do!

00:16:56.496 --> 00:16:59.541
-Jeez, where are we going?
-Just come. Hurry up.

00:16:59.624 --> 00:17:01.668
It's right here.

00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:03.711
-We're here.
-A video arcade?

00:17:06.881 --> 00:17:08.591
Look, it's Kang Pil-gu!

00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:10.635
You have to lower the claw
around the body.

00:17:10.718 --> 00:17:13.137
-Come on.
-Have you never done this before?

00:17:16.474 --> 00:17:18.643
-Darn it!
-Come on.

00:17:18.726 --> 00:17:21.563
-It's all about accuracy. Try again.
-Okay.

00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:23.731
Yes, right there. Just a bit more…

00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:27.193
-No, I got it!
-You have to aim higher!

00:17:27.277 --> 00:17:29.487
Just trust me. Right now!

00:17:32.448 --> 00:17:33.283
Oh, come on!

00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:36.035
Seriously?

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:37.829
Don't do that.

00:17:38.413 --> 00:17:40.540
Jeez, this is how you do it.

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:49.132
Yes!

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.980
Why is this place so empty?

00:18:04.063 --> 00:18:05.315
I rented out the whole place.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.275
What?

00:18:07.984 --> 00:18:10.320
I can't rent out a place for free
like you can,

00:18:10.987 --> 00:18:13.072
but adults are at work,
and students are at school

00:18:13.573 --> 00:18:14.490
on a weekday like this.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.576
So I rented it at a low price.

00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:19.412
Why did you spend money on this?

00:18:19.495 --> 00:18:21.539
Let's go and take some photos.
There's a booth over there.

00:18:23.249 --> 00:18:24.083
Let's go.

00:18:25.376 --> 00:18:27.003
Right, photos are what last.

00:18:31.007 --> 00:18:31.966
Smile!

00:18:38.765 --> 00:18:40.308
-Me?
-Here you go.

00:18:41.225 --> 00:18:42.060
There.

00:18:42.727 --> 00:18:43.645
Smile!

00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:47.315
Try these on too.

00:18:52.654 --> 00:18:53.696
Smile!

00:18:56.741 --> 00:18:57.575
Smile!

00:19:02.872 --> 00:19:05.667
LIM HYEON-JUN & WI JEONG-SIN

00:19:10.964 --> 00:19:11.798
Here.

00:19:20.682 --> 00:19:23.184
Man, it's been ages since I've had
ramyeon at a convenience store.

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:24.852
So I guess you're fine with this.

00:19:25.603 --> 00:19:28.272
You grumbled so much
when we had ramyeon at the Hangang River.

00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:32.610
Only teenagers come here to eat ramyeon

00:19:32.694 --> 00:19:34.028
and make memories over it.

00:19:34.612 --> 00:19:36.406
I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:39.242
I tend to grumble even if I'm happy.

00:19:39.784 --> 00:19:41.869
I really enjoyed that day, you know.

00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:55.299
What about today?

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:56.968
Did you enjoy it too?

00:19:57.927 --> 00:20:00.680
You said what you envied the most
was an ordinary life.

00:20:01.347 --> 00:20:04.475
That's why I wanted to
spend an ordinary day with you,

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:05.852
just like everyone else.

00:20:07.228 --> 00:20:08.396
So how was it? Did you enjoy it?

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:09.981
It couldn't have been better.

00:20:10.481 --> 00:20:11.315
It was a date, after all.

00:20:15.236 --> 00:20:16.070
The truth is…

00:20:17.447 --> 00:20:18.948
there's something I need to tell you.

00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:22.076
Seria?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.661
You're going to a war zone?

00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:24.871
Are you insane?

00:20:24.954 --> 00:20:27.582
I know it's dangerous,
but I've been there before--

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:29.542
Exactly, you've been there already!

00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:31.002
So why go back to a war zone?

00:20:31.085 --> 00:20:32.420
To return to the political desk.

00:20:35.673 --> 00:20:36.507
Also,

00:20:36.591 --> 00:20:39.927
did you even consider me
when you made that decision?

00:20:40.762 --> 00:20:43.890
Is that why
you took me to the arcade today?

00:20:43.973 --> 00:20:45.266
Are you some cruel mom

00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:47.894
who takes her kid to the park
before abandoning him?

00:20:47.977 --> 00:20:50.563
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

00:20:50.646 --> 00:20:52.190
A cruel mom who abandons her kid?

00:20:52.273 --> 00:20:53.858
How could you say that to me?

00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:55.693
I wanted us to have a good time,

00:20:55.777 --> 00:20:58.029
so I spent all day thinking about
how to make it enjoyable for us.

00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:01.032
Why would you dismiss the effort I put in?

00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:03.534
Why are you getting angry at me?

00:21:03.618 --> 00:21:04.535
So you think

00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:06.537
pulling a stunt
like going to Seria was smart?

00:21:06.621 --> 00:21:07.580
"Pulling a stunt"?

00:21:07.663 --> 00:21:09.040
Of course, it's a stunt!

00:21:09.123 --> 00:21:11.417
Are you showing off
or just being reckless?

00:21:11.501 --> 00:21:13.753
How does it make any sense for you to say

00:21:13.836 --> 00:21:15.797
that you're going back there again?

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.800
Do I look like someone
who would go there just to show off?

00:21:19.842 --> 00:21:21.844
I'm going there to work, not to have fun!

00:21:22.804 --> 00:21:23.721
I don't get it.

00:21:24.972 --> 00:21:26.641
Why are you doing this?

00:21:27.141 --> 00:21:28.810
You don't have to go!

00:21:29.727 --> 00:21:30.770
But I do.

00:21:33.898 --> 00:21:35.149
It's already been decided.

00:21:40.571 --> 00:21:41.572
Come on!

00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:43.866
Damn it!

00:21:47.203 --> 00:21:48.329
But why…

00:21:49.372 --> 00:21:50.456
You don't have to go.

00:21:51.332 --> 00:21:52.208
I mean…

00:22:04.512 --> 00:22:06.013
Seriously!

00:22:06.556 --> 00:22:07.640
Go.

00:22:07.723 --> 00:22:10.059
Just go! Leave!

00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:15.857
Don't you ever call me again!

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.774
If you do, I'll…

00:22:28.077 --> 00:22:30.663
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF

00:22:53.352 --> 00:22:56.397
WOO YOUNG-SUK, AIDE

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.524
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO

00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:37.688
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:24:03.464 --> 00:24:04.757
You don't have to go!

00:24:05.341 --> 00:24:06.259
But I do.

00:24:08.678 --> 00:24:10.304
It's already been decided.

00:24:59.395 --> 00:25:00.354
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin?

00:25:01.355 --> 00:25:03.733
May I have a moment of your time?

00:25:17.204 --> 00:25:18.914
It's the first time in my life.

00:25:18.998 --> 00:25:20.541
I've never liked someone…

00:25:21.917 --> 00:25:23.586
so unconditionally.

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:46.400
I like you.

00:25:49.153 --> 00:25:52.615
I haven't liked anyone
for a very long time.

00:25:55.034 --> 00:25:56.035
But…

00:25:57.787 --> 00:25:59.372
I have a feeling I'll like you…

00:26:01.415 --> 00:26:03.125
for a long time to come.

00:26:07.505 --> 00:26:08.422
Are you okay?

00:26:14.887 --> 00:26:17.765
Did you even consider me
when you made that decision?

00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:19.558
Are you some cruel mom

00:26:19.642 --> 00:26:21.769
who takes her kid to the park
before abandoning them!

00:26:21.852 --> 00:26:24.772
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

00:26:29.443 --> 00:26:30.611
So how was it? Did you enjoy it?

00:26:30.694 --> 00:26:32.238
It couldn't have been better.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.864
It was a date, after all.

00:26:38.202 --> 00:26:40.287
Even so, you going to Seria

00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:42.164
won't resolve anything.

00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:46.127
If I let things go on like this,

00:26:47.169 --> 00:26:50.506
everyone will assume all the rumors
about Mr. Lim are true.

00:27:09.984 --> 00:27:11.944
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:37.052
If you go, when will you be back?

00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:39.305
I don't know for sure yet.

00:27:41.348 --> 00:27:43.100
How can you not know that?

00:27:43.184 --> 00:27:44.643
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:27:51.817 --> 00:27:53.694
Don't you hate me?

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.030
You lost all your ad deals,

00:27:56.947 --> 00:27:58.282
and even your reputation hit rock bottom.

00:27:58.365 --> 00:28:00.910
I was the one who suggested it.
Why do you keep talking like it's on you?

00:28:04.455 --> 00:28:06.415
You can't possibly be okay.

00:28:08.292 --> 00:28:10.085
On top of all those articles
attacking you personally…

00:28:12.338 --> 00:28:14.048
even Kang Pil-gu is getting criticized.

00:28:15.007 --> 00:28:16.050
I don't regret what I did.

00:28:22.431 --> 00:28:23.849
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:28:25.142 --> 00:28:26.018
For getting mad at you.

00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:28.979
I was the one who raised my voice first.

00:28:30.898 --> 00:28:31.732
I'm sorry.

00:28:36.487 --> 00:28:38.072
So you're not mad at me anymore?

00:28:39.573 --> 00:28:41.158
I was never mad at you.

00:28:46.622 --> 00:28:47.456
I'll wait for you.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.753
-Mr. Lim--
-No.

00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:55.422
Waiting for you is my choice.

00:28:55.506 --> 00:28:57.258
You made your own choice to leave too.

00:29:00.553 --> 00:29:02.388
You're leaving the day after tomorrow?

00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:04.265
Yes.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:08.435
That's the last day of shooting
for Kang Pil-gu, right?

00:29:13.983 --> 00:29:14.984
Then today's our last day.

00:29:17.486 --> 00:29:19.363
Why would you say that?

00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:20.906
Like we'll never see each other again?

00:29:31.292 --> 00:29:32.751
Take care while I'm gone, okay?

00:30:00.904 --> 00:30:03.532
What if I begged you not to go?

00:30:06.493 --> 00:30:07.411
Would you still leave?

00:30:10.831 --> 00:30:11.874
Yes.

00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:41.570
Move that over there.

00:30:51.997 --> 00:30:54.500
LIM HYEON-JUN & WI JEONG-SIN

00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:02.091
Hey, can you bring that over?

00:31:03.592 --> 00:31:05.177
-Hey.
-Where does this go?

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.095
Bro.

00:31:07.137 --> 00:31:08.055
It's time to finish up your makeup.

00:31:08.555 --> 00:31:09.390
Okay.

00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:11.266
Jeez.

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:13.977
Ms. Wi must be on her way
to the airport by now.

00:31:15.312 --> 00:31:16.188
Let's go.

00:31:22.194 --> 00:31:23.737
I said I'd come with you.

00:31:23.821 --> 00:31:25.572
Forget it. Give me that.

00:31:29.785 --> 00:31:30.869
Take care of yourself.

00:31:30.953 --> 00:31:33.622
If you get hurt like last time,
I won't make it.

00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:34.748
Okay, I heard you.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.176
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.804
Mr. Lim couldn't come,
so he asked me to take you to the airport.

00:31:48.887 --> 00:31:50.431
No, that's okay.

00:31:50.514 --> 00:31:52.099
Ms. Wi, if you don't get in,

00:31:52.182 --> 00:31:53.016
I'll get fired.

00:32:01.316 --> 00:32:02.484
I'll get in, then.

00:32:02.568 --> 00:32:03.444
Thank you.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.649
What am I going to do?

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.318
Cut. Okay!

00:33:36.829 --> 00:33:37.913
Mr. Lim, that was great.

00:33:39.373 --> 00:33:40.207
Huh?

00:33:42.334 --> 00:33:43.335
Here.

00:33:43.877 --> 00:33:47.005
All right, that's a wrap
for Good Detective Kang Pil-gu Season 5.

00:33:47.089 --> 00:33:48.423
Thank you for all your hard work.

00:33:48.507 --> 00:33:49.633
Thank you!

00:33:55.722 --> 00:33:56.723
-Mr. Lim.
-Yeah?

00:33:57.432 --> 00:33:58.892
Thank you for all your hard work.

00:34:00.894 --> 00:34:02.312
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:03.981
I mean it.

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:06.358
Come on, Mr. Lim. Stop that.

00:34:07.484 --> 00:34:08.360
Byeong-gi…

00:34:10.237 --> 00:34:13.073
Mr. Lim, your acting today was phenomenal.

00:34:14.741 --> 00:34:15.576
Thank you.

00:34:16.368 --> 00:34:17.661
-Great work.
-You too.

00:34:30.757 --> 00:34:31.592
Bro!

00:34:32.426 --> 00:34:33.260
Look.

00:34:34.261 --> 00:34:35.137
Look at this.

00:34:36.013 --> 00:34:37.723
LIM HYEON-JUN & GWON SE-NA
ALREADY CUT TIES WITH CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO

00:34:38.557 --> 00:34:42.019
-Oh, it's been published.
-Ms. Wi really is something.

00:34:42.102 --> 00:34:44.021
She'd been thinking a step ahead

00:34:44.104 --> 00:34:47.024
to make a move
and turn the situation around.

00:34:47.774 --> 00:34:50.527
The advertisers have been
calling nonstop to apologize.

00:34:51.528 --> 00:34:53.447
When Ms. Wi said
we should donate our shares,

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.157
what was your response again?

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.035
Once Chairman Lee Dae-ho is exposed,

00:34:58.118 --> 00:34:59.828
it could cause a big problem
for the company

00:34:59.912 --> 00:35:01.330
and for both of you as well.

00:35:01.997 --> 00:35:03.081
So I was thinking…

00:35:04.207 --> 00:35:05.375
How about we do this?

00:35:05.459 --> 00:35:06.376
Do what?

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.962
The two of you will take
all of your company shares

00:35:09.838 --> 00:35:11.340
-and donate them.
-Sure.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.383
-What?
-Let's do it.

00:35:13.884 --> 00:35:15.302
Come on, let's do it.

00:35:15.385 --> 00:35:18.305
You want us to donate our shares?

00:35:18.388 --> 00:35:20.223
-Like, all of it?
-Yes.

00:35:20.307 --> 00:35:21.725
Where should we donate it?

00:35:21.808 --> 00:35:24.394
What do you mean,
"Where should we donate it?"

00:35:24.478 --> 00:35:25.812
I can't do that!

00:35:26.396 --> 00:35:27.814
Come on.

00:35:27.898 --> 00:35:30.359
I donated it all anyway.

00:35:30.943 --> 00:35:33.487
Anyway, Ms. Wi saved us both.

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.655
Right?

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.198
But I wonder why

00:35:36.281 --> 00:35:38.116
she released the article
under Ms. Yun's name.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.451
Because it'd look too set up?

00:35:44.081 --> 00:35:46.959
How could we possibly read into
Ms. Wi's master plan?

00:35:50.087 --> 00:35:52.255
By the way, I looked into that thing.

00:35:52.339 --> 00:35:55.092
There was an issue with
how your dismissal as CEO was handled.

00:35:55.175 --> 00:35:56.677
So you can actually be reinstated.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.261
-Seriously?
-Quiet.

00:35:58.345 --> 00:35:59.763
Hey, keep it down.

00:35:59.846 --> 00:36:02.140
-Seriously?
-Yes, but…

00:36:02.224 --> 00:36:04.893
Since you don't own a single share
of company stock,

00:36:04.977 --> 00:36:06.645
you could get fired at any time.

00:36:06.728 --> 00:36:09.815
So do a good job, okay?

00:36:09.898 --> 00:36:10.816
Got it?

00:36:12.067 --> 00:36:12.901
Okay.

00:36:14.027 --> 00:36:15.445
KANG PIL-GU SEASON 5
VIEWERSHIP RATINGS

00:36:15.529 --> 00:36:16.571
RATINGS EXCEED 20%
A TRIUMPHANT FINALE

00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:17.531
A SLOW START,
BUT SOARS TO 20.6%!

00:36:17.614 --> 00:36:18.615
THE KANG PIL-GU CREW
IS REWARDED PAID VACATION AGAIN!!

00:36:18.699 --> 00:36:19.866
KANG PIL-GU 5 CONCLUDES
WITH RECORD RATINGS

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.535
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

00:36:21.618 --> 00:36:24.162
As this is said to be
the final season of Kang Pil-gu,

00:36:24.246 --> 00:36:25.706
the viewers are deeply disappointed.

00:36:25.789 --> 00:36:27.165
Is it truly over?

00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:29.292
Yes.

00:36:29.376 --> 00:36:30.585
That's the case for now.

00:36:31.169 --> 00:36:33.755
It can't continue
just because I want it to.

00:36:35.007 --> 00:36:35.841
But…

00:36:36.758 --> 00:36:38.885
if there's a chance down the road,

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.264
I'd love to meet Kang Pil-gu again.

00:36:46.184 --> 00:36:47.060
Wow.

00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:50.480
Deep down,

00:36:51.773 --> 00:36:52.733
I already miss him.

00:36:54.985 --> 00:36:57.446
Well, Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:36:57.529 --> 00:37:00.157
Is there anyone else that you miss
or would like to see right now?

00:37:01.867 --> 00:37:02.701
Yes.

00:37:06.329 --> 00:37:07.247
There is.

00:38:07.265 --> 00:38:09.810
AT NUNGNAE STATION

00:38:12.104 --> 00:38:13.814
A PLACE WHERE LONGING GATHERS LIKE SNOW

00:38:16.066 --> 00:38:18.110
AND TENDER GREETINGS GATHER
LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES

00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:35.585
If you'd like, I can share
a simple feel-good method.

00:38:36.378 --> 00:38:39.798
Go outside on a sunny day
and simply stand there.

00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:40.966
That's it?

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.260
After standing for a while,

00:38:43.343 --> 00:38:45.720
your head will start to feel warm
from the sunshine.

00:38:46.221 --> 00:38:48.098
When that happens,

00:38:48.682 --> 00:38:50.642
it feels like someone
is gently stroking your head.

00:38:58.358 --> 00:38:59.317
It feels warm.

00:39:13.456 --> 00:39:14.583
Kang Pil-gu is

00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:18.295
really, really special.

00:39:19.296 --> 00:39:22.132
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

00:39:23.049 --> 00:39:24.259
How lucky is that?

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.815
Wow, what's this?

00:39:39.399 --> 00:39:40.859
-What's all this?
-Goodness.

00:39:40.942 --> 00:39:42.360
-You're back already?
-Yes.

00:39:42.444 --> 00:39:44.571
I was going to leave
right after making dinner,

00:39:44.654 --> 00:39:46.781
but I forgot to make you soup.

00:39:46.865 --> 00:39:47.949
What kind of soup?

00:39:48.033 --> 00:39:49.534
Oh, seaweed soup.

00:39:50.118 --> 00:39:51.203
That sounds delicious.

00:39:51.286 --> 00:39:52.996
Sit down. Let's eat together.

00:39:54.122 --> 00:39:55.832
-Together?
-Yes.

00:40:02.088 --> 00:40:05.175
So, is that nice lady reporter

00:40:05.258 --> 00:40:06.509
still not back from Seria yet?

00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:09.512
How do you know her?

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:11.640
Oh, well…

00:40:11.723 --> 00:40:13.892
I came by once

00:40:13.975 --> 00:40:17.145
and found her here
while she was recovering from the flu.

00:40:17.229 --> 00:40:18.063
I see.

00:40:19.564 --> 00:40:21.942
Mom, you didn't
say anything weird, did you?

00:40:23.276 --> 00:40:24.527
Of course I didn't.

00:40:27.322 --> 00:40:28.865
When she gets back,

00:40:28.949 --> 00:40:30.742
could you introduce me to her?

00:40:36.456 --> 00:40:37.290
Okay.

00:40:37.374 --> 00:40:38.416
Really?

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.793
Yeah.

00:40:41.461 --> 00:40:42.337
I'll bring the soup.

00:40:52.764 --> 00:40:55.058
Can you please stop nagging me?

00:40:55.558 --> 00:40:57.644
I told you I couldn't call
because I lost my phone.

00:40:57.727 --> 00:40:59.813
Are you sure you're not lying?

00:40:59.896 --> 00:41:01.147
I'm not lying.

00:41:01.231 --> 00:41:03.525
I had a hard time
borrowing this phone to call you.

00:41:03.608 --> 00:41:05.151
Are you badly hurt?

00:41:05.235 --> 00:41:08.571
I was told your injury was pretty severe.

00:41:08.655 --> 00:41:09.489
I'm fine.

00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:10.949
Get better and come home.

00:41:11.533 --> 00:41:13.660
Is there anything you want to eat
when you return?

00:41:14.703 --> 00:41:15.829
It'll be my treat.

00:41:30.552 --> 00:41:32.721
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN

00:41:34.973 --> 00:41:37.225
Gosh, she's heartless.

00:41:37.726 --> 00:41:39.811
She hasn't texted me once.

00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:54.326
WI JEONG-SIN

00:42:18.808 --> 00:42:19.642
She's so cute.

00:42:24.773 --> 00:42:26.066
You were adorable.

00:42:37.827 --> 00:42:38.703
My phone!

00:42:44.501 --> 00:42:46.044
Oh, man.

00:42:50.256 --> 00:42:51.341
It's on.

00:42:51.424 --> 00:42:52.342
It's working.

00:43:02.852 --> 00:43:03.686
It's working.

00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.943
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:43:10.026 --> 00:43:11.611
HOW ARE YOU? THE WEATHER IS NICE HERE.
COME BACK SOON.

00:43:11.694 --> 00:43:13.279
I WENT TO THE HANGANG RIVER TODAY.
I MISS YOU.

00:43:25.125 --> 00:43:27.085
EVERYTHING'S OKAY, RIGHT?
I'LL TELL MYSELF THAT NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS

00:43:40.765 --> 00:43:41.599
ONION

00:43:46.563 --> 00:43:48.356
MELOMASTER
A LONELY SINGLE KANG PIL-GU SOCK

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:00.452
I found a single Kang Pil-gu sock
all by itself in Hannam-dong.

00:44:00.535 --> 00:44:02.287
It's being kept safe at the moment.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.373
If you have lost it,
please contact me promptly

00:44:05.457 --> 00:44:08.168
and rescue this Pil-gu sock
from loneliness.

00:44:08.251 --> 00:44:10.753
I can be reached anytime.

00:44:10.837 --> 00:44:11.754
However,

00:44:11.838 --> 00:44:13.965
transactions are strictly in person.

00:44:14.048 --> 00:44:15.383
PRICE: 1,000,000 WON

00:44:22.515 --> 00:44:24.142
This is hilarious.

00:44:28.062 --> 00:44:28.938
It's too much.

00:44:58.676 --> 00:44:59.511
Huh?

00:45:01.387 --> 00:45:02.263
Hey, Seon-u!

00:45:03.723 --> 00:45:05.058
Seon-u!

00:45:05.141 --> 00:45:06.518
Yeah? What is it?

00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:08.228
-Get over here.
-What's going on?

00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:09.729
This right here.

00:45:10.271 --> 00:45:13.024
This is an email
inviting me to their audition, right?

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:16.277
YOU ARE ONE OF THE
FINAL CANDIDATES FOR THIS ROLE.

00:45:16.361 --> 00:45:17.820
OUR PRODUCER, MARK JONES,
WILL BE VISITING SEOUL.

00:45:17.904 --> 00:45:18.780
Right?

00:45:18.863 --> 00:45:20.240
Yeah, you're right.

00:45:21.324 --> 00:45:23.451
It's not just an audition.
You're a final candidate.

00:45:25.578 --> 00:45:27.622
Hyeon-jun, they're coming to see you!

00:45:33.586 --> 00:45:36.589
"For the role of Kevin Kim."

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:38.925
So my name will be Kevin Kim?

00:45:39.008 --> 00:45:40.093
Onion!

00:45:50.061 --> 00:45:52.397
Do you still have the single sock?

00:45:57.652 --> 00:45:58.778
Yes, I still have it.

00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:03.074
I think that sock's mine.

00:46:03.157 --> 00:46:06.661
I think that Kang Pil-gu sock
belongs to me.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.957
You need to bring
the other sock to verify it.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.000
Okay.

00:46:12.083 --> 00:46:13.042
I'll bring it.

00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:20.008
When can we make the transaction?

00:46:20.091 --> 00:46:21.968
The poorsock is so lonely,

00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:24.262
it's on the verge of depression.

00:46:25.346 --> 00:46:27.015
Oh, dear.

00:46:27.098 --> 00:46:29.183
I'm overseas at the moment.

00:46:30.226 --> 00:46:31.728
How about next month on the 23rd?

00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:32.979
The 23rd?

00:46:39.152 --> 00:46:40.111
The 23rd.

00:46:41.279 --> 00:46:43.323
You're making me wait too long.

00:46:43.823 --> 00:46:45.033
If this deal falls through,

00:46:45.116 --> 00:46:47.493
I'm sure the other buyers
will be thrilled.

00:46:47.577 --> 00:46:48.661
No, wait!

00:46:48.745 --> 00:46:50.622
I promise I'll buy it.

00:46:53.499 --> 00:46:54.751
SCHEDULE A TRANSACTION

00:46:56.502 --> 00:46:57.503
AN APPOINTMENT HAS BEEN BOOKED

00:46:57.587 --> 00:47:00.214
Where would you like to meet
for the transaction?

00:47:01.341 --> 00:47:02.508
How about the N Seoul Tower?

00:47:02.592 --> 00:47:03.926
That sounds good.

00:47:06.179 --> 00:47:08.973
I actually had a bad experience
at N Seoul Tower once.

00:47:09.057 --> 00:47:11.309
But I want to put it behind me now.

00:47:11.392 --> 00:47:14.145
Then meet me on the 23rd at 8 p.m.,

00:47:14.228 --> 00:47:16.356
by the love locks at the N Seoul Tower.

00:47:16.856 --> 00:47:20.234
You won't send
someone else in your place, will you?

00:47:20.735 --> 00:47:22.779
If you're curious, hurry up and come.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.738
Let me look at you.

00:48:48.614 --> 00:48:49.449
You didn't get hurt?

00:48:50.074 --> 00:48:51.033
I missed you.

00:48:54.912 --> 00:48:56.247
Didn't you miss me?

00:48:57.498 --> 00:48:59.167
Of course, I missed you!

00:48:59.917 --> 00:49:03.171
Jeez, how could you not text me once?

00:49:04.172 --> 00:49:07.383
I lost my phone, and something came up.

00:49:08.885 --> 00:49:09.761
I'm sorry.

00:49:12.472 --> 00:49:14.807
It's okay. I understand.

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:19.020
I've been doing pretty well.

00:49:19.604 --> 00:49:21.689
Things aren't as bad for me as I expected.

00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:25.318
A lot of people told me
that I did what Kang Pil-gu would've done.

00:49:26.402 --> 00:49:27.779
I knew it.

00:49:27.862 --> 00:49:29.113
It's the truth, after all.

00:49:49.592 --> 00:49:51.219
Wait, is it okay for us to be like this?

00:49:52.053 --> 00:49:53.721
Stop worrying about what others think.

00:49:53.805 --> 00:49:55.431
Who cares what they think?

00:50:10.279 --> 00:50:14.116
HYEON-JUN & JEONG-SIN

00:50:37.723 --> 00:50:38.766
Will you be leaving again?

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.812
Why? Are you afraid I might?

00:50:42.895 --> 00:50:43.813
Hey.

00:50:44.814 --> 00:50:47.650
I won't let go of your hand
if you go somewhere dangerous again.

00:50:49.026 --> 00:50:49.861
Where should I go?

00:50:49.944 --> 00:50:50.778
What?

00:50:52.113 --> 00:50:52.947
So you'll leave again?

00:50:54.156 --> 00:50:55.533
I'm not going anywhere.

00:50:56.242 --> 00:50:57.243
Are you sure?

00:50:58.119 --> 00:50:59.871
-Fine, I'll go then.
-Hey.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.877
Home sweet home.

00:51:06.502 --> 00:51:07.670
There's no place like home.

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.478
GWON SE-NA ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT
AND LEAVES FOR A FASHION SCHOOL IN THE US

00:51:37.575 --> 00:51:39.911
Wow, is this for real?

00:51:39.994 --> 00:51:42.580
I can't believe
you're going to be in a Hollywood movie.

00:51:43.539 --> 00:51:45.958
All of our effort has finally paid off.

00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:47.793
I know, right?

00:51:47.877 --> 00:51:52.298
Back when we recorded your audition tape
and you were doing lines from Goblin,

00:51:52.381 --> 00:51:54.675
I wondered what the hell we were doing.

00:51:54.759 --> 00:51:57.678
Who would've thought
a day like this would come?

00:51:58.429 --> 00:52:02.141
They say the road less traveled
is never easy.

00:52:03.893 --> 00:52:06.938
By the way, Mr. Hwang.
Why have you been so busy lately?

00:52:07.021 --> 00:52:08.272
I never see you around.

00:52:09.065 --> 00:52:11.817
He's been really busy because of Hong-sin.

00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:13.194
"But I do!"

00:52:13.277 --> 00:52:15.947
Very nice.
Raise the handcuffs a bit higher.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.199
Let's go for a more intense gaze
and a different pose.

00:52:19.158 --> 00:52:21.285
-That's great.
-Good Detective Kang Pil-gu!

00:52:21.369 --> 00:52:22.453
Right, King's Back does need

00:52:22.536 --> 00:52:25.665
a new actor to follow in the footsteps
of Lim Hyeon-jun.

00:52:27.124 --> 00:52:29.168
Speaking of which, Seon-u…

00:52:29.752 --> 00:52:32.713
He's holding up as an intern right now.
He won't turn to acting again, will he?

00:52:32.797 --> 00:52:34.882
Of course not!

00:52:34.966 --> 00:52:38.219
He's too busy with his internship
at the hospital.

00:52:38.302 --> 00:52:40.262
Please save him!

00:52:40.346 --> 00:52:42.390
Secure his airway
and get ready to intubate him.

00:52:42.473 --> 00:52:43.891
The intubation kit is ready.

00:52:43.975 --> 00:52:45.685
I have to say, he's really smart.

00:52:45.768 --> 00:52:48.854
He realized his path early on
and went for it.

00:52:49.855 --> 00:52:52.024
He's smart because he takes after me.

00:52:53.025 --> 00:52:54.527
By the way, I saw you reading a script.

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:55.653
Was it for me?

00:52:57.738 --> 00:52:59.115
The thing is,

00:52:59.198 --> 00:53:02.910
we did get a streaming series script, but…

00:53:04.578 --> 00:53:07.498
Gosh, how do I explain this?

00:53:09.041 --> 00:53:10.042
It's just that…

00:53:11.293 --> 00:53:12.837
-Let's see it.
-Yeah.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.922
It's titled Double Investigation.

00:53:15.006 --> 00:53:17.550
And it's another detective series, I know.

00:53:18.217 --> 00:53:20.386
I read it too
and thought it was really good.

00:53:20.469 --> 00:53:21.762
It's really good.

00:53:23.222 --> 00:53:24.223
So a detective?

00:53:24.306 --> 00:53:25.641
Me, as a detective?

00:53:25.725 --> 00:53:28.811
Yes, you'd play a detective,
but it's a really good…

00:53:28.894 --> 00:53:30.146
-It's good.
-It is.

00:53:30.229 --> 00:53:31.188
Like, totally.

00:53:31.272 --> 00:53:32.523
It's totally good.

00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:35.317
It's total…

00:53:35.401 --> 00:53:38.904
These TV station guys are total jerks!

00:53:38.988 --> 00:53:40.990
He was great as Kang Pil-gu,
but they can't keep giving him

00:53:41.073 --> 00:53:43.451
-the same old detective roles!
-Right.

00:53:43.534 --> 00:53:45.119
We should just tear this script apart.

00:53:45.202 --> 00:53:46.996
No, let me see it.

00:53:47.079 --> 00:53:48.789
No, I'm so offended right now.

00:53:48.873 --> 00:53:51.000
I mean, it is a really good story!

00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:52.418
But we need to tear it up!

00:53:52.501 --> 00:53:55.504
-Fine, I heard you. Give it to me.
-Why?

00:53:55.588 --> 00:53:57.423
Not all detectives are the same.

00:53:58.299 --> 00:53:59.633
I'm a different kind of detective.

00:54:00.259 --> 00:54:01.260
I'll give it a read.

00:54:03.262 --> 00:54:06.557
Bro, you've totally changed.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.601
Hey, should I ask Mr. Bak

00:54:08.684 --> 00:54:10.811
to write a new season of Kang Pil-gu?

00:54:12.188 --> 00:54:13.898
I think he's busy writing something else.

00:54:13.981 --> 00:54:17.276
"Like a scene from a painting,

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:20.112
their silhouettes
fade into the city lights…"

00:54:21.113 --> 00:54:22.323
THE END

00:54:22.406 --> 00:54:24.075
NICE TO NOT MEET YOU
SCRIPT

00:54:24.158 --> 00:54:26.952
"A connection destined by fate,
born from a rice cooker transaction."

00:54:27.703 --> 00:54:29.163
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:54:29.246 --> 00:54:30.790
Come on, Mr. Son.

00:54:30.873 --> 00:54:32.833
The buzzword these days is "harmlessness."

00:54:32.917 --> 00:54:34.502
I've moved on from crime stories

00:54:34.585 --> 00:54:36.921
to ones that are
lighthearted and harmless.

00:54:37.004 --> 00:54:40.049
It only makes sense
that a script that's written by you

00:54:40.132 --> 00:54:44.428
has cars flipping left and right
and metal pipes flying everywhere.

00:54:44.512 --> 00:54:46.097
But "Nice to Not Meet You"?

00:54:46.639 --> 00:54:48.599
Jeez, even the title is tacky.

00:54:49.517 --> 00:54:50.559
It's retro.

00:54:51.268 --> 00:54:52.770
And what about the cast?

00:54:52.853 --> 00:54:55.648
Who'd want to be in a rom-com
written by the writer of Kang Pil-gu?

00:54:55.731 --> 00:54:56.565
Kang Pil-gu himself?

00:54:57.858 --> 00:54:59.276
That's not a bad idea.

00:55:11.372 --> 00:55:12.623
Be careful when you're running.

00:55:12.706 --> 00:55:13.541
Okay.

00:55:16.585 --> 00:55:17.419
Here.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.507
FAMILY RELATIONSHIP CERTIFICATE

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:22.758
WIFE: YUN HWA-YEONG, CHILD: LEE JAE-HA

00:55:26.428 --> 00:55:28.055
It looks like
Yun Jae-ha is now Lee Jae-ha.

00:55:31.016 --> 00:55:32.226
It makes me a little sad.

00:55:33.727 --> 00:55:34.770
It's like you've stolen my son.

00:55:37.106 --> 00:55:38.440
He's my son, too, you know.

00:55:42.903 --> 00:55:44.363
Don't be so sad.

00:55:44.989 --> 00:55:46.907
You got yourself
an amazing husband in return.

00:55:48.909 --> 00:55:49.910
You're right.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.417
-Jae-ha.
-Yes?

00:55:57.334 --> 00:55:58.460
-Are you having fun?
-Yes.

00:56:02.131 --> 00:56:03.465
Here, I'll do it for you.

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.727
Hey, Su-ji. Are you sleeping?

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:15.728
Of course not.

00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:18.689
I'm awake at all times for you, Mr. Lim.

00:56:24.653 --> 00:56:27.239
There's a woman I'd like to propose to.

00:56:27.323 --> 00:56:28.407
Who's this skank?

00:56:31.452 --> 00:56:32.745
-What?
-I'm just kidding.

00:56:32.828 --> 00:56:34.371
Please continue.

00:56:37.666 --> 00:56:39.627
There's a woman I really like.

00:56:40.252 --> 00:56:42.338
What would be
the best way to propose to her?

00:56:46.884 --> 00:56:47.968
Su-ji?

00:56:48.928 --> 00:56:50.846
-Su-ji?
-I didn't quite get that.

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:52.097
Hey, Su-ji!

00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:53.390
What's wrong with her?

00:56:58.229 --> 00:57:00.231
Why are you suddenly playing trot music?

00:57:02.233 --> 00:57:03.150
Hey, Su-ji!

00:57:03.984 --> 00:57:04.860
Su-ji…

00:57:12.993 --> 00:57:15.871
"ASK ME ANYTHING"

00:57:17.873 --> 00:57:19.124
Give me a dramatic

00:57:19.667 --> 00:57:23.170
and fail-proof idea to propose to someone.

00:57:24.213 --> 00:57:26.715
The key element is sincerity.

00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:29.468
How about expressing your feelings

00:57:29.551 --> 00:57:31.303
in a place where they felt most genuine?

00:57:31.387 --> 00:57:32.221
If you would like,

00:57:32.304 --> 00:57:34.932
I can give you step-by-step instructions.

00:57:37.476 --> 00:57:38.394
Wow.

00:57:39.353 --> 00:57:40.896
You understand me right away.

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:44.608
All right,
walk me through it step by step.

00:58:10.426 --> 00:58:11.844
Did you see the article this morning?

00:58:13.053 --> 00:58:14.763
Well, it was bound to happen.

00:58:16.348 --> 00:58:19.101
The chief called me and gave me an earful.

00:58:19.184 --> 00:58:20.394
Hey, Wi Jeong-sin.

00:58:20.477 --> 00:58:21.478
Have you lost your mind?

00:58:21.562 --> 00:58:23.814
How could you let another outlet
publish this exclusive?

00:58:23.897 --> 00:58:26.984
Come on, don't let it bother you.

00:58:27.067 --> 00:58:28.152
Don't worry about it.

00:58:29.361 --> 00:58:30.821
I dreamed of coming back to Korea

00:58:30.904 --> 00:58:34.825
and sitting on a park bench like this,
basking in the sun as much as I wanted.

00:58:35.701 --> 00:58:36.744
I love it.

00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:38.537
And I'm right here, next to you.

00:58:39.496 --> 00:58:40.331
Right in front of me, too.

00:58:46.003 --> 00:58:47.838
I thought it'd be a huge deal

00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:50.716
if an ordinary person like me
dated an actor.

00:58:51.342 --> 00:58:53.427
-But it really isn't.
-Of course, it's not.

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.930
Why was I so intimidated
by the idea back then?

00:58:57.848 --> 00:58:58.891
Somebody once said

00:58:58.974 --> 00:59:01.268
that it's the simple,
everyday life that saves us.

00:59:03.604 --> 00:59:07.024
Life is easiest
when it's simple and calm like this.

00:59:08.067 --> 00:59:09.526
What else is there in life?

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.445
The greatest happiness
is just being comfortable.

00:59:12.488 --> 00:59:13.655
Wow, that's lame.

00:59:16.909 --> 00:59:17.910
Shall we walk?

00:59:31.799 --> 00:59:33.550
Catch me if you can!

00:59:40.307 --> 00:59:42.351
SEONGIL STATION

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:46.563
Jeez, what's taking them so long?

00:59:50.317 --> 00:59:51.777
I'm sure they'll find me on their own.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.320
Wow, it's that scene now.

00:59:53.404 --> 00:59:54.863
-Onion!
-"Onion"?

00:59:57.991 --> 00:59:58.867
Onion?

01:00:13.298 --> 01:00:14.299
You're here from Onion, right?

01:00:14.383 --> 01:00:15.467
What?

01:00:15.551 --> 01:00:17.511
Oh, that's right. Onion.

01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:18.470
Is this it?

01:00:20.597 --> 01:00:22.474
I just sent you 320,000 won
through Onion Pay.

01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:24.476
Excuse me?

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.019
How was I supposed to know what that is?

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.815
I'm a fan of Seo U-jin.

01:00:30.858 --> 01:00:32.192
-Thank you.
-All right, then.

01:00:33.569 --> 01:00:34.403
Excuse me.

01:00:39.324 --> 01:00:41.452
Do you like Seo U-jin?

01:00:43.745 --> 01:00:44.997
Do you like…

01:00:46.582 --> 01:00:47.416
Lim Hyeon-jun?

01:00:47.499 --> 01:00:48.876
Yes, I do.

01:00:51.378 --> 01:00:52.921
It's the first time in my life.

01:00:54.006 --> 01:00:56.300
I've never liked someone
so unconditionally.

01:01:00.554 --> 01:01:02.389
Why did you tell him about this part?

01:01:02.473 --> 01:01:03.682
-Why not?
-I can't…

01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:04.892
Could you keep it down?

01:01:04.975 --> 01:01:05.809
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

01:01:09.062 --> 01:01:10.564
Hey, it's Lim Hyeon-jun.

01:01:10.647 --> 01:01:12.274
-Really?
-It's Lim Hyeon-jun.

01:01:12.357 --> 01:01:14.359
It's Lim Hyeon-jun!

01:02:34.022 --> 01:02:35.857
